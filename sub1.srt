1
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:29,375
What the hell?

2
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,833
What are you doing, Varun?

3
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:33,875
Instead of treating him first,
you've been treating a terrorist?!

4
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,000
I was just trying to treat him.

5
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,416
He has got JVP laceration
and a flail chest.

6
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:39,708
He can't be saved.

7
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:42,458
But in his case, only the hand is injured.

8
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,583
A simple amputation
can save his life.

9
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,791
Do you know who is he?

10
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,916
Retd. Col. Sandeep Gowda's son!

11
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,625
So what? Why are you
getting emotional about it?

12
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,125
Let's be practical.

13
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,250
Despite making an effort, he will die.

14
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:57,750
Instead, we can save him and
gather information in the future.

15
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,333
Just think practically.

16
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:02,875
Proceed!

17
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,375
<i>I've reached a decision</i>
<i>after thinking this through.</i>

18
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,083
<i>We're not a good match.</i>

19
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,375
<i>Let's call off this wedding. Bye.</i>

20
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:28,166
<i>The number you have dialed is currently</i>
<i>busy. Please try again later.</i>

21
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,708
SIX MONTHS AGO

22
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:44,208
<i>Her beautiful face caught my attention</i>

23
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:51,791
<i>I was enchanted when her shadow grazed me</i>

24
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:59,791
<i>Her beautiful face caught my attention</i>

25
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:07,333
<i>I was enchanted when her shadow grazed me</i>

26
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:38,041
Do you always fasten
the top button of your shirt?

27
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,541
Isn't that the purpose of it?

28
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,375
Sure.

29
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:49,916
<i>I've sent a gift for you.</i>

30
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:51,791
<i>I know it's a gift.</i>

31
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,041
But what is it?

32
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,958
<i>It's a book called</i>
<i>How To Be Perfect In Life.</i>

33
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,375
You look extremely disciplined.

34
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,500
What time do you usually
wake up in the morning?

35
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:05,666
At 4:30 a.m.

36
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,833
Is it because you deliver
milk in the morning?

37
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,333
No, I wake up to study.

38
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:10,375
Study!

39
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:14,000
-You look beautiful.
-Thank you.

40
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,916
<i>No girl I have ever met</i>

41
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:29,083
<i>Has killed me with her beauty</i>
<i>And then resurrected me</i>

42
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:37,250
<i>No girl I have ever met</i>

43
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:43,666
<i>Has killed me with her beauty</i>
<i>And then resurrected me</i>

44
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:49,708
<i>The time spent walking with you</i>

45
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:52,333
<i>Is a blessing to me</i>

46
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:55,083
<i>I relentlessly look for you all night</i>

47
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:59,375
<i>I have lost myself</i>
<i>After having found you</i>

48
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:57,000
-Can I take a picture?
-Sure, go ahead.

49
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,000
But please delete it right after.

50
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:37,083
{\an8}PRESENT DAY

51
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,333
Hey, don't forget to
take your lunch box.

52
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,166
Please don't run your mouth
out there. We'll do the talking.

53
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,583
I'll try my best not to.

54
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,250
-But I can't help it if they go overboard.
-Bye, Mom!

55
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,333
She's definitely going to
reject you. Stay strong!

56
00:07:58,416 --> 00:07:59,375
Keep moving.

57
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,125
I don't know how to put it across.

58
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:11,125
It's kind of hard for us to say this.

59
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,250
Calling off the wedding…

60
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,166
is not an easy task, but…

61
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:21,375
it is good that they understood
they're not compatible with each other.

62
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,958
Had this been the case post marriage…

63
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,541
it would have been tough.

64
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,291
Don't generalize it.

65
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,666
Can you please specify
why they are not compatible?

66
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:33,416
-Well, I can't go into detail--
-Sister-in-law, let me explain it clearly.

67
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,583
Let them get some clarity.

68
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:39,166
Auntie, I have a few expectations
from my husband-to-be.

69
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,791
Would you care to elaborate?

70
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:45,708
I mean I want him to be
positive, emotional and caring.

71
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,916
I expected someone who
gives importance to emotions.

72
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:54,541
But, Auntie, your son
is emotionally detached.

73
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,958
You're too young to be
contemplating one's character.

74
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,083
It's based on the little things I noticed.

75
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,583
The other day, I sent him a text saying,

76
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,916
"I'm very tired and my legs are
hurting from shopping since morning."

77
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,958
Do you know what
his reply to that text was?

78
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,833
What was your reply?

79
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,875
Omega 350. One tablet in
the morning and one at night.

80
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,625
Did you hear that?
I expected a different reply from him.

81
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,250
"Oh, no! Your legs are hurting?!

82
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:21,625
If I were there, I would have
made you a hot cup of tea

83
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:22,958
and massaged your legs."

84
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,083
Auntie, I want a husband who cares,

85
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:27,500
and not just some doctor who…

86
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,416
prescribes medicine.

87
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,625
Having a doctor in the family
is a good thing, dear.

88
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:35,083
I can get a doctor's appointment
if I need to see one, Uncle.

89
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,458
I don't really have to get married to one.

90
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,333
If I face a problem with
the water supply at home,

91
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,125
I wouldn't just marry a plumber, right?

92
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,041
-Correct.
-Uncle, you can be quiet as usual.

93
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,375
I'll talk to Auntie about it.

94
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:48,625
Mini…

95
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:52,000
I think you're mistaken about him.

96
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,291
Don't you say a word!

97
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,166
Dad doesn't like sister-in-law at all.

98
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:56,333
He didn't want you to marry her.

99
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:59,291
Because he thought if you did,
you'd become her slave.

100
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,208
I'm not trying to
drive a wedge between you two.

101
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,125
Just saying!

102
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,958
You still got married to her, right?

103
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,458
You went your own way.

104
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,791
Similarly, calling off
this wedding is my wish.

105
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,541
Sister-in-law, I like you very much.

106
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,291
I liked you the very first time I met you.

107
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,583
When your father was hospitalized,

108
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,833
I sent his reports to him
and asked for his opinion.

109
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,041
Do you know what he replied?

110
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:22,583
Ask him yourself.

111
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:24,958
What did you tell her?

112
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,750
I told her that he'd die
within the next 12 hours.

113
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:30,583
And just as he predicted,
he died within the next 12 hours.

114
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,541
Well, he was right, dear.

115
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,125
He did die as per the prediction.

116
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,500
Him passing was not an issue at all.

117
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,000
It's just not right to say
something so negative.

118
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,666
"There's nothing to worry about.
Everything will be fine."

119
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,333
He should say such positive things!

120
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,958
How can you state
a negative report as positive?

121
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,500
You must. You have to
be positive about it.

122
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,166
Positivity is everything.

123
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,750
If you go to a dead person

124
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:55,208
and whisper, "You're fine.
There's nothing to worry about",

125
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,375
they might even come back to life.

126
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,833
I've told you a million times
that pretty girls are stupid.

127
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,291
See for yourself.

128
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:05,166
Two doctors getting married
will make a perfect match.

129
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:10,625
Listen, I don't like to
beat around the bush.

130
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,041
Let me be honest with you.
I don't like you.

131
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,208
Same to you.

132
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,916
I'm happy that you called off the wedding.

133
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,916
Come on, let's go.

134
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,541
Let him come when he wants to.
We should leave.

135
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:24,833
My son…

136
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,041
They have left.

137
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:34,333
Are we done?

138
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:35,666
I'm running late.

139
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:36,916
My dad…

140
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:54,583
Son…

141
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,250
would you like some tea?

142
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:03,708
Do you believe in God?

143
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:05,458
I do, sir.

144
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:09,958
God has saved you
from this disastrous wedding.

145
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:13,541
If you let her into your life,
she will certainly ruin it.

146
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,916
You saw how she tried to turn
my daughter-in-law against me.

147
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:19,958
We will eventually be in trouble.

148
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:23,916
For our daughter's well-being, we chose
a humble prospective groom like you.

149
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,500
But she insulted and humiliated
you in front of everyone.

150
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,708
Your parents are bound to be furious.

151
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:30,958
There's nothing wrong with you.

152
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:34,375
You're well-educated, good
looking and well-behaved.

153
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,041
You'll find yourself a perfect match.

154
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:39,000
But she deserves to be taught a lesson.

155
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,833
She needs someone who can keep her
under control and break her arrogance.

156
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,541
Uncle, I'm an arrogant man.

157
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,916
-Yes, Preethi?
-<i>Did Chinnu come home?</i>

158
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,833
What are you saying?
Didn't you go to pick up her?

159
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,125
<i>They said that school</i>
<i>was over in the afternoon.</i>

160
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,500
<i>-But I can't find Chinnu.</i>
-What?

161
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,791
<i>-I'm really scared!</i>
-I don't get it! Are you kidding me?

162
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,750
-Did you ask the security guard?
<i>-Ma'am, I checked with everyone.</i>

163
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,208
-What happened?
-You stay right there. I'm coming.

164
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,750
-I'm coming to the school.
-What happened?

165
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,833
-What happened?
-Chinnu had a half-day school today.

166
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:25,083
And now, Preethi can't find her.
Get me my purse!

167
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,958
-Get over here!
-She must be at her friend's place.

168
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,625
-You get over here!
-Call Priya's mother.

169
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,750
-Please book a cab.
-I'll get my phone.

170
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,291
-Check if she booked a cab.
-She's on it.

171
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,458
I'm calling Priya.

172
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,416
Hello, Priya?
This is Priyanka's mother speaking.

173
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,416
-Did she come to your house?
-The cab will be here in three minutes.

174
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,666
-Okay. Can you share Samyuktha's number?
-Did you check with the driver?

175
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:48,958
Thank you, dear.

176
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,541
-Dad, you stay at home.
-Okay, I'll stay back.

177
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,541
-This way?
-Yes, it will come this way.

178
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,708
-What happened?
-Chinnu had a half-day at school.

179
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:59,166
She's neither at school nor did
she come home. I'm worried.

180
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,333
-Did you inquire at the school?
-That's where we're going.

181
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,125
We've booked a cab.

182
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:04,583
Cab?

183
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,916
Can I drop you guys in my car?

184
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:13,208
-You call your uncle. I'll call Sukanya.
-Mom, what did Preethi say?

185
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,333
-Is she at the school--
-Please wear your seat belt.

186
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,458
Is this Sukanya's mother?
This is Priyanka's mother speaking.

187
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:19,791
Is she at your place?

188
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,791
-Please wear your seat belt.
-Oh, is it?

189
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:24,541
-Please put Sukanya on the phone.
-Uncle, this is Navneet speaking.

190
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:28,750
-Hello? Sukanya, when did Priyanka leave?
-Chinnu had a half-day at school today.

191
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,125
I wanted to check if she came over.

192
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,083
Oh, I see.

193
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,583
-Ask her to call me if she comes over.
-Okay, Uncle.

194
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,208
Thank you, dear.

195
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,625
-She's not at Uncle's house.
-She didn't go to Sukanya's house.

196
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,916
Making a scene about the situation

197
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,458
or yelling at people and accusing them
of negligence is not going to help.

198
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:52,000
We have a half-day off because
the school correspondent passed away.

199
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:56,250
Please file a complaint at the police
station and start looking for your child.

200
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,125
We'll support you and
do everything in our power.

201
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,000
Let's hope for the best.

202
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,916
Sir, I've filed an FIR.

203
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,583
We've already started
to look for your daughter.

204
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,125
Please don't worry.

205
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:15,416
If you go into depression, it will
be difficult to find your daughter.

206
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,125
You have to be strong
and face the situation.

207
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:23,541
Yes?

208
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,500
Okay.

209
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,416
Muthu, remember to pick up

210
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,708
my daughter from the coaching class
at 5:00 p.m. tomorrow.

211
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,875
In case someone has kidnapped her,

212
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,833
they will call you either
to threaten you or demand ransom.

213
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,125
And if they call by any chance,
we need to track and monitor the call.

214
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,916
So, we'll have one of our men
stationed at your house. Okay?

215
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,833
-Where is Bhagat?
-He's on his way, sir.

216
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:12,875
They summon me as they please,
and they expect me to appear at once.

217
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,291
-Sir…
-As if I'm a sitting duck!

218
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:15,916
-What is it?
-Do you remember me, sir?

219
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,333
Your name is Daniel D'Souza.

220
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,250
You are an engine driver
at Metro Railways.

221
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,875
Your daughter's name
is Angelina D'Souza.

222
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,708
Last month on the 8th around 8:00 p.m.

223
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,541
your daughter went missing
on her way to school.

224
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:28,333
Age, 12. Height, 5'2". Weight, 41 kg.
She has brown eyes.

225
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:31,083
Is that enough or should I mention
the names of your ancestors as well?

226
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,208
-What, are you testing my memory?
-No, sir.

227
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,333
-I didn't mean to--
-I know where you're getting at.

228
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,500
You want to ask if we will
find your daughter or not.

229
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,625
-Yes, sir.
-Shall I lie or tell you the truth?

230
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,000
Please tell me the truth, sir.

231
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,375
If I tell you the truth,
you'll get emotional.

232
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,750
So, I'll lie to you.
We'll definitely find your daughter.

233
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,500
You should be careful
with your belongings.

234
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,458
I was very careful, sir.

235
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,250
Sir…

236
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,458
what is the matter?

237
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,375
It's been a month and half
since my daughter went missing.

238
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:04,875
We have no idea where she is
and what happened to her.

239
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:07,666
What are they saying?

240
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,125
They said they will let me
know if they find her.

241
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:11,875
When will they find her?

242
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,416
I've been asking them
the same question every day.

243
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,166
But they don't seem to have an answer.

244
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,416
Please ask them to say something!

245
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,666
At least ask them to tell me
if daughter has died!

246
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,458
Did any unknown person
visit your house recently?

247
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:30,708
Good morning, sir!

248
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,125
Why are you shouting?

249
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,041
Did you eat?

250
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,125
You do one thing.

251
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:40,958
Their daughter has gone missing.

252
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:42,916
Sir.

253
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,458
You go to their house and tap their
phone if they receive a threatening call.

254
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,000
Monitor it closely.

255
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,500
Oh, no! This has become a routine now.

256
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,750
You promised to recommend me
to the department.

257
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,750
But you've been
assigning me the same job.

258
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,750
How long do you expect
me to record phone calls?

259
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:00,166
When will I get to join
the department and break the record?

260
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,875
You're talking too much.
You don't have to do it.

261
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,541
-I'll send someone else.
-Oh, no!

262
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,875
I'll go.

263
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,041
Come on!

264
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,958
There's nothing more important
than finding your daughter.

265
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,416
That's enough. Go.

266
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,916
Hey, stay put inside the house.
Don't step out.

267
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,250
Shall I stay put even if
I have to use the restroom?

268
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,500
Everything's perfect. Final checking.

269
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,875
I'm hungry. I'll be back
once I'm done with my meal.

270
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,500
Sir, you're being irresponsible.

271
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,166
What if we get a call
while you're away?

272
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,708
Well, I'm hungry!

273
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,166
You just had your coffee.

274
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,208
Oh! So, you're keeping an account?!

275
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,958
This might be your first case,
but it's my 17th case.

276
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:44,458
If an eight-year-old goes missing,
she will never come back.

277
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,291
It's probably a case
of human trafficking.

278
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,791
Sir, what is human trafficking?

279
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:51,250
It means trading of human beings.

280
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:54,083
Don't tell me that someone
might call demanding a ransom!

281
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,958
You have three bedrooms. Each one
of you can pick one and cry in there!

282
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,250
No one seems to have
understood a thing I said.

283
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,166
Only he seems to have understood it.

284
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,208
He has accepted the truth and
is planning to have another child.

285
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:09,416
But… why is he locking
himself in the room?

286
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:14,625
Oh, my! You instigated
him to commit suicide!

287
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,291
Hey, shut up! Damn it!

288
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,791
Oh, God! Someone, please save him!

289
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,958
What happened?
Please hear me out!

290
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,291
Hey, go and break down the door!

291
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,041
I can't break down the door!
I'll end up getting hurt!

292
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,000
Step aside!

293
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,250
You better save him before I get back.

294
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,500
I hope everything's fine.

295
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,750
If you're gutsy enough
to commit suicide…

296
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:50,750
why don't you pluck up the courage
to find your daughter?

297
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,416
Let the police do their job.

298
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,000
We should also look for her.

299
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,916
Listen, the police
will never look for her.

300
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,291
They will never help
ordinary people like us.

301
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,750
If the child of a politician or
a commissioner had gone missing,

302
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,333
they would have brought down
the military to look for them.

303
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:06,791
Your second option
is the right thing to do.

304
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,541
Only you have to
look for your daughter.

305
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,041
Listen to him and look
for her as long as you can.

306
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,708
If you can't, then please die.

307
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,833
Let me see who comes to save you.

308
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,625
Until then, do not
take that saree off the fan.

309
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:21,333
What are you looking at?

310
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,500
Your niece is missing
and you're glaring at me!

311
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,958
Would you like it
if I do the same to you?

312
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,083
Irresponsible lady!

313
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:34,541
As far as I know, you think
from others' perspective.

314
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:38,125
But in this case, you're not thinking
from your daughter's perspective.

315
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,041
What would she think?

316
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,041
She has a father.

317
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,625
I'm sure she's hoping that you
will manage to save her somehow.

318
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:50,208
If you kill yourself, you will also be
shattering your daughter's hopes.

319
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:02,750
<i>Oh, heart! Oh, my dear heart!</i>

320
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,791
<i>It's bound to thaw and shatter</i>

321
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,500
<i>Come closer, my dear heart!</i>

322
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:11,208
<i>It's bound to thaw</i>

323
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:16,375
<i>Oh, heart! Oh, my dear heart!</i>

324
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,500
<i>It's bound to thaw and shatter</i>

325
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:21,416
<i>Come closer, my dear heart!</i>

326
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,958
<i>It's bound to thaw</i>

327
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,000
MISSING

328
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:32,791
<i>Nightmares have been keeping me up</i>
<i>I can't stop thinking about you</i>

329
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:39,583
<i>This pain has shattered me into pieces</i>

330
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:43,791
<i>I have only suffered since you went away</i>

331
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:47,166
<i>The separation has left me distraught</i>

332
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:53,750
<i>Oh, my dear!</i>
<i>This pain is unbearable</i>

333
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:57,583
<i>I have only suffered since you went away</i>

334
00:21:57,666 --> 00:22:00,958
<i>The separation has left me distraught</i>

335
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:07,708
<i>Oh, my dear!</i>
<i>This pain is unbearable</i>

336
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:11,708
In the last four years,
400 girls have went missing.

337
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,416
It'd be a very big deal even if
ten of them had been found.

338
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,916
I'm being honest
because you're my friend.

339
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,875
You won't find your daughter.

340
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,666
I've asked my men
to look for your daughter.

341
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:27,291
I'm not able to do it.
It's not in my power to find her.

342
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:29,708
You keep looking for her.
That's the right thing to do.

343
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:40,416
<i>Don't leave me and go far away</i>

344
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:47,458
<i>My eyes can't bear the burden of tears</i>

345
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,916
<i>I will stay by your side forever</i>
<i>Like a shadow</i>

346
00:22:55,750 --> 00:23:01,208
<i>A shadow doesn't have a voice</i>

347
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:09,791
<i>I'm going to live a life in solitude</i>

348
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:13,833
<i>The pain is gut-wrenching</i>
<i>The memories haunt me</i>

349
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:15,583
<i>I'm breaking down</i>

350
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:22,750
<i>Nightmares have been keeping me up</i>
<i>I can't stop thinking about you</i>

351
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:29,333
<i>This pain has shattered me into pieces</i>

352
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:33,541
<i>I have only suffered since you went away</i>

353
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:36,916
<i>The separation has left me distraught</i>

354
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:43,708
<i>Oh, my dear!</i>
<i>This pain is unbearable</i>

355
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:47,250
<i>I have only suffered since you went away</i>

356
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:50,666
<i>The separation has left me distraught</i>

357
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:54,583
<i>Oh, my dear! This pain…</i>

358
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:57,458
Navneet, I feel your pain, brother.

359
00:23:57,583 --> 00:24:00,416
I've informed all the officials about it.

360
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,041
They'll find your daughter for sure.

361
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:04,250
But the MLA is expecting some money.

362
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:07,541
So, pay him six lakh rupees
as compensation.

363
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:10,791
Subramani, he's my friend.
Make sure everything goes well.

364
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:14,625
<i>Oh, heart! Oh, my dear heart!</i>

365
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,791
<i>It's bound to thaw and shatter</i>

366
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:19,625
<i>Come closer, my dear heart!</i>

367
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,791
<i>It's bound to thaw</i>

368
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:28,333
<i>Oh, heart! Oh, my dear heart!</i>

369
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:30,000
That was not Chinnu.

370
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:33,416
<i>Come closer, my dear heart!</i>

371
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:36,750
<i>It's bound to thaw</i>

372
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:45,666
Colonel, I had mentioned
about a missing girl, right?

373
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,291
This is her father and this is--

374
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,458
This is my medical check-up
report from last week.

375
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:55,250
Give me your opinion.

376
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:12,083
Your creatinine and
uric acid levels are high.

377
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:14,458
You ought to reduce your alcohol intake.

378
00:25:16,291 --> 00:25:17,416
What if I don't?

379
00:25:19,916 --> 00:25:21,291
You'll die soon.

380
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:24,708
Okay.

381
00:25:27,541 --> 00:25:28,833
Now, tell me.

382
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:31,791
A girl has gone missing.

383
00:25:32,208 --> 00:25:35,500
That's her father, that's her
mother and that's Padmini.

384
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:36,541
Hello, sir.

385
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:40,000
-Fiancée?
-Ex-fiancée, Colonel.

386
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:46,750
Alright, I'll speak to the commissioner
and ask him to pressurize the team.

387
00:25:46,875 --> 00:25:49,333
They will just add two more
police officers in the search.

388
00:25:49,416 --> 00:25:50,333
That's it.

389
00:25:50,666 --> 00:25:52,750
There's no guarantee
that we'll find the girl.

390
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:56,041
It seems you already
have a plan in place.

391
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,333
What are you going to do?

392
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:01,583
Kidnapping.

393
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,541
He wants to kidnap
the commissioner's daughter!

394
00:26:06,791 --> 00:26:08,500
Instead of finding a way to find Chinnu,

395
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:11,000
he's planning to get all of us in trouble.

396
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:13,791
He wants to abduct the commissioner's
daughter because our child is missing!

397
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:15,625
Damn that guy!
He pegs himself as a genius.

398
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:17,000
You know how bizarre this sounds?

399
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:19,708
It's like being advised to change
undies to get rid of knee pain!

400
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:21,208
Absolutely ridiculous!

401
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:23,666
I wonder how someone can
come up with such an idea!

402
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,250
He has no sense whatsoever…

403
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:29,041
We have no sense.

404
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:32,791
That's why God has
sent you here as a blessing.

405
00:26:34,583 --> 00:26:36,125
I'm getting late for the meeting.

406
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:37,416
See you around.

407
00:26:39,708 --> 00:26:42,541
If we happen to find Chinnu
during the process…

408
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:46,541
I'll have you know that I don't intend
to use it to my advantage to marry you.

409
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:48,375
I thought of letting you know.

410
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:49,875
So, I did.

411
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:51,208
Okay.

412
00:26:56,458 --> 00:26:58,416
We all are aware
what we are about to do.

413
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:01,833
We may think about a million things
before performing a surgery.

414
00:27:02,291 --> 00:27:04,291
But once the blade touches the body…

415
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,791
without having second thoughts or
wondering whether we'll succeed or fail,

416
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:10,041
we should keep doing our job like a robot.

417
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:13,750
In a situation like this,
emotion is your worst enemy.

418
00:27:14,583 --> 00:27:16,458
We ought to detach
ourselves from emotions.

419
00:27:16,541 --> 00:27:17,416
Okay?

420
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:21,250
How can we do something
without having emotions?

421
00:27:21,416 --> 00:27:24,500
Feelings, love, care…
all of this matters, you know?

422
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,833
In our mission to find Chinnu,

423
00:27:26,916 --> 00:27:29,458
I'm the commander and
you people are the soldiers.

424
00:27:29,666 --> 00:27:33,500
So, you will only listen
to me and follow my orders.

425
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,541
Discipline in military
is of the utmost importance.

426
00:27:35,916 --> 00:27:38,166
And I don't like you
talking to me like that.

427
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:40,291
Get up and get out.

428
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:41,500
What?

429
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:44,541
Are you going or shall I leave?

430
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:46,041
Dear!

431
00:27:57,416 --> 00:27:58,791
I hope you people are okay with it.

432
00:27:59,041 --> 00:28:00,833
Now that we've decided to risk our lives,

433
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:03,000
it doesn't matter if we get hanged
to death or die in an accident.

434
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:04,416
It's all the same.

435
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:09,500
He threw me out too.

436
00:28:13,583 --> 00:28:15,791
If you do as I say,
I'll pay you 1000 rupees.

437
00:28:16,208 --> 00:28:18,833
If you come and beg along
with me, I'll pay you 3000 rupees.

438
00:28:19,916 --> 00:28:22,166
Oh, God!
Fine, I'll pay you 5000 rupees.

439
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:25,541
Do you really think
I'll toil to make 5000 rupees?

440
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:27,041
How much do you want?

441
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:28,833
Can you pay me 10,000 rupees?

442
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:32,916
You didn't tell me who you are.

443
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,000
If I tell you who I am,
I'll give you 10,000 rupees.

444
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:36,458
If I don't, then I'll
give you 20,000 rupees.

445
00:28:37,166 --> 00:28:38,416
I don't care about your identity.

446
00:28:39,041 --> 00:28:40,083
Do you know to play cricket?

447
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:41,666
Do you know to bowl?

448
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:52,500
Hey, little boy! How are you?

449
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:56,208
If I strike, I'll score a boundary!

450
00:28:57,458 --> 00:28:58,958
-Kid, please move aside.
-Did you watch the CSK match?

451
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:00,583
-It was super!
-Camera 1. The view is clear.

452
00:29:00,666 --> 00:29:02,541
-Camera 2 and 3, be ready.
-Dhoni, rocked the match!

453
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:05,458
Dhoni is in position.
But no one has recognized him yet.

454
00:29:05,666 --> 00:29:06,708
Be alert.

455
00:29:12,166 --> 00:29:13,541
Dhoni?

456
00:29:15,416 --> 00:29:16,708
Don't mention it to anyone.

457
00:29:17,166 --> 00:29:19,041
Okay!

458
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:20,500
Let's go.

459
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:24,041
Hey, Dhoni is here!

460
00:29:24,833 --> 00:29:27,166
That's great, kids! Okay!

461
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:29,625
One by one!

462
00:29:29,708 --> 00:29:31,083
Okay, good!

463
00:29:39,583 --> 00:29:41,875
Navneet, don't panic.

464
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:43,958
Keep calm and do it casually.

465
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,625
<i>Take out the handkerchief from your pocket</i>

466
00:29:46,791 --> 00:29:50,041
<i>and hold it against the girl's</i>
<i>nose and mouth for ten seconds.</i>

467
00:29:50,458 --> 00:29:52,458
<i>Be cool. Don't be scared.</i>

468
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,708
Kids, one by one!

469
00:29:55,791 --> 00:29:58,333
-Dhoni! One autograph, please!
-Dhoni!

470
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:13,833
Dhoni, please give me an autograph!

471
00:30:13,916 --> 00:30:16,125
Dhoni, I want your autograph!

472
00:30:26,583 --> 00:30:28,041
Oh, my God!

473
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:33,125
Hey! Uncle, please return my bat!

474
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,291
Uncle, please give it back to me!

475
00:30:37,583 --> 00:30:38,625
Please stop!

476
00:30:39,958 --> 00:30:41,375
Uncle, give it back to me!

477
00:30:41,666 --> 00:30:43,375
-Uncle!
-Hey!

478
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:46,833
Stop running!

479
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,541
Come on, start the car!

480
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:53,500
We didn't come here to filch this bat!

481
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:55,416
-Put on the mask!
-Sorry. Yeah, give me that.

482
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:58,208
Uncle, please return my bat!

483
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:01,166
Uncle, my bat!

484
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,833
Where's my bat?

485
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,958
Where have you people
been all this while?

486
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:22,375
-We went to the movies.
-To the movies?!

487
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:25,291
You were about to hang yourself yesterday.
And today, you went to the movies!

488
00:31:25,375 --> 00:31:27,416
Are you planning to have
a family picnic tomorrow?

489
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:28,666
Idiot!

490
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:34,416
What's in that sack?

491
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,083
We bought popcorn.

492
00:31:36,666 --> 00:31:39,166
Popcorn? It looks like a bag full of crap!

493
00:31:39,416 --> 00:31:41,083
Why would you need
such a big sack for popcorn?

494
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:42,291
Untie the sack.

495
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:45,833
Will you open it or
should I call the police?

496
00:31:45,916 --> 00:31:47,708
Damn it! How did he find out?

497
00:31:49,083 --> 00:31:51,250
-Hey, stop gawking at me!
-Who tied the sack?

498
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:52,916
-I did.
-Just do as I say!

499
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:56,333
Don't you dare try to scare a policeman,
or you'll be done for!

500
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:59,875
You bring the sack inside
the house. I'll talk to him.

501
00:31:59,958 --> 00:32:02,708
What will you say to me?
Why the hell are you pushing me?

502
00:32:02,791 --> 00:32:05,083
Will you hit me? How dare
you lay a hand on a cop!

503
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:06,458
Get inside. Come on, hurry.

504
00:32:06,666 --> 00:32:08,375
We kidnapped the AC's daughter.

505
00:32:08,458 --> 00:32:11,083
Why the hell did you
kidnap the AC's daughter?

506
00:32:12,541 --> 00:32:16,166
Didn't you say that the police won't
bother looking for ordinary people,

507
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:18,666
but they'll hunt down the kidnapper
if it's one of their own?

508
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,750
Correct.

509
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:22,250
If the AC's daughter is missing,
they will only look for her.

510
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:23,750
How would that help
in finding Chinnu?

511
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,458
We can find out the process
of hunting down a kidnapper.

512
00:32:26,541 --> 00:32:27,416
How?

513
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,291
You have a police walkie-talkie.

514
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,875
Oh!

515
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:35,750
So, that's your plan!

516
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,250
What if the police hunt you down first?

517
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:40,458
You people will get caught.
What will you do then?

518
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,708
Don't worry.
I swear I won't rat you out.

519
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:44,291
Well, you should tell about me!

520
00:32:44,375 --> 00:32:48,708
Everyone should know that I was
the mastermind behind this kidnapping.

521
00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:51,125
Only then will they
be careful with Bhagat.

522
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:52,333
By the time the case comes to an end,

523
00:32:52,416 --> 00:32:55,750
I should either chase the criminal as a
police, or chase the police as a criminal!

524
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:58,666
Hey, I'm talking to you!
Why won't you pay heed to me?

525
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,250
We'll make them run, sir.

526
00:33:04,666 --> 00:33:05,791
<i>Sir, we caught them.</i>

527
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,333
<i>-We're checking the vehicles now.</i>
<i>-We've arrested everyone in this area.</i>

528
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,500
<i>-Right here, at J7 police station.</i>
<i>-Name of the accused is Ramanujam.</i>

529
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:11,875
<i>-That's right, sir.</i>
<i>-Okay, sir.</i>

530
00:33:11,958 --> 00:33:13,958
<i>We're on the lookout, sir.</i>

531
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:15,416
<i>Hey, check that vehicle!</i>

532
00:33:15,916 --> 00:33:17,875
<i>Sir, we have nabbed</i>
<i>four people until now.</i>

533
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,250
You're Dhoni, right?

534
00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:27,916
So, you won't answer me!

535
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:30,791
How dare you engage in kidnapping?

536
00:33:31,041 --> 00:33:32,166
I'll skin you alive!

537
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:34,666
You had been decently
begging all this while.

538
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,708
You should have continued it.

539
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:38,166
Why did you engage in kidnapping?

540
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:40,958
-Hey, get him something to eat.
-Okay, sir.

541
00:33:42,125 --> 00:33:44,625
Would you like to eat something, Dhoni?

542
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:46,625
What are you saying?

543
00:33:48,833 --> 00:33:49,916
Hey, hit it right!

544
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,958
I bet 500 rupees on you.
Don't you worry, I'm right here.

545
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:54,500
Come on, man! Do it!

546
00:33:54,583 --> 00:33:55,750
You managed to strike again.

547
00:33:56,291 --> 00:33:57,541
Now it's my turn.

548
00:33:58,208 --> 00:33:59,166
Come on.

549
00:33:59,791 --> 00:34:01,916
Philip, don't be scared.

550
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:04,250
Don't lose this game,
or I'll lose 500 rupees.

551
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:05,500
Come on, strike it hard!

552
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:06,916
Don't spare him.

553
00:34:07,458 --> 00:34:09,166
He's totally hopeless!

554
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,375
You, moron! Don't you
understand what I am saying?

555
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:14,250
You look like an owl
hanging on a noose.

556
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,000
Hey, don't you think twice
before placing a bet?

557
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:18,791
Didn't you think twice
before kidnapping a girl?

558
00:34:18,958 --> 00:34:20,125
Do you have a warrant?

559
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:21,958
Start the jeep.

560
00:34:22,958 --> 00:34:25,125
Come on! Step out of the van.

561
00:34:25,208 --> 00:34:26,333
Get out of here!

562
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:31,750
-Buddy!
-Yes, brother?

563
00:34:31,958 --> 00:34:33,916
Business is dull these days.

564
00:34:34,208 --> 00:34:36,583
-Karma is a boomerang.
-<i>Karunas?</i>

565
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:38,916
I said karma, not <i>karunas</i>.

566
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:43,375
Earlier, someone else would take the heat
for the kidnapping done by us.

567
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:47,125
Now someone else has done the kidnapping
and we're bearing the brunt of it!

568
00:34:47,458 --> 00:34:51,458
The police have kidnapped me
more than I've kidnapped people.

569
00:34:51,708 --> 00:34:54,500
-What is this case about?
-The AC's daughter has been kidnapped.

570
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:57,083
Someone kidnapped the AC's daughter?!

571
00:34:57,166 --> 00:34:59,083
As if there's a scarcity of girls in town!

572
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:01,583
Who has the audacity
to kidnap the AC's daughter?

573
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:04,083
Oh, no!

574
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:10,666
That moron stepped
on my foot. Damn it!

575
00:35:12,541 --> 00:35:14,750
Sir, we have arrested all
the kidnappers in the city.

576
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,500
I'm sure one among
them is the kidnapper.

577
00:35:17,666 --> 00:35:20,041
One of you has messed
with a police officer's family.

578
00:35:20,625 --> 00:35:21,750
The culprit's hands will be severed!

579
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:27,916
Eat it.

580
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:29,791
Please eat it, dear.

581
00:35:38,791 --> 00:35:40,833
That girl has been crying unceasingly.

582
00:35:40,958 --> 00:35:42,500
I feel sorry for her.

583
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:44,458
You feel sorry for her?

584
00:35:44,833 --> 00:35:47,083
Well then, drop her home.
I'll get going.

585
00:35:47,166 --> 00:35:48,416
No. That's not what I meant.

586
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,166
I just said that I feel pity for her.

587
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:54,708
I've been working day in, day out
since your niece went missing.

588
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:57,125
Don't you feel sorry for me?

589
00:35:57,416 --> 00:36:00,583
-She hasn't eaten anything since morning--
-She'll eat when she is hungry.

590
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:04,208
-Do you feel sorry for her too?
-No.

591
00:36:04,583 --> 00:36:05,916
I'm having fun.

592
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:08,333
We're not on a vacation to have fun.

593
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:09,708
Go!

594
00:36:09,791 --> 00:36:11,291
You yell at me all the time.

595
00:36:11,541 --> 00:36:12,416
I'm leaving.

596
00:36:12,916 --> 00:36:14,250
-Go.
-Stop smiling!

597
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:16,333
Wear your damn masks!

598
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:19,875
Sir, you're beating up the wrong guy!

599
00:36:19,958 --> 00:36:21,333
Sir, we're not the kidnappers!

600
00:36:21,625 --> 00:36:23,458
Oh, God! Sir, it hurts!

601
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:25,583
One minute! They have found the girl.

602
00:36:25,791 --> 00:36:27,083
You don't say!

603
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:31,125
I've been telling you since the beginning.

604
00:36:31,458 --> 00:36:33,541
A professional kidnapper
would never do such a thing.

605
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,375
But you didn't listen to me.

606
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:51,500
Stop right there!

607
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:54,791
Preethi, pretend to be unconscious.

608
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,708
Hey, step out of the van!

609
00:36:57,791 --> 00:36:59,250
Do not step out of the van
until I ask you to.

610
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:01,166
Stop staring at me. Get out!

611
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:03,750
Sir, Preethi is unconscious.
We have to take her to the hospital.

612
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:05,791
Didn't you hear me?
Enough with the nonsense!

613
00:37:05,875 --> 00:37:07,541
-Please, sir.
-Step outside, I said!

614
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:10,125
Come on, let's get down.
I think they have an emergency.

615
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:11,916
We'll find another vehicle.
Please get down.

616
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,916
-Sir, please believe me…
-Hey, spectacles! Get down, man!

617
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,625
-You too, woman!
-I'm not lying, sir.

618
00:37:15,708 --> 00:37:17,083
Hey, I'm going to kill you.

619
00:37:17,708 --> 00:37:19,583
Hey, Killi! Come on, hurry up!

620
00:37:19,875 --> 00:37:21,041
Why are you pleading with them?

621
00:37:21,333 --> 00:37:23,833
She has fainted. We have
to take her to the hospital.

622
00:37:23,916 --> 00:37:26,791
Oh, really?
Hey, drag her out of the van!

623
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,541
Hey, why you don't get it?

624
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:30,833
Hey, stop touching her!
Just pick her up.

625
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:32,833
-Hold her properly.
-Sir, she has fainted.

626
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:34,750
Enough with your drama!
Pull her out of the van.

627
00:37:34,875 --> 00:37:36,500
It's like a truck inside
this shared transport!

628
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:38,375
-Hey, get her out.
-Sir, I don't want any trouble.

629
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,541
How dare you lay a hand on me!

630
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:43,416
-Come on.
-Hey, that's enough. Put him in the van!

631
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:46,541
You guys are pissing me off!

632
00:37:46,666 --> 00:37:49,875
I asked you to gag him, and
you let him bite your finger!

633
00:37:49,958 --> 00:37:51,541
You're being rather unprofessional.

634
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:53,833
If you continue to be like this,
you'll be a worthless rogue.

635
00:37:53,916 --> 00:37:56,166
Hey, Killi! What the hell is this?

636
00:37:59,791 --> 00:38:00,833
-Idiot!
-Damn it!

637
00:38:00,916 --> 00:38:03,041
You didn't notice the gun
and pulled a knife at him!

638
00:38:04,791 --> 00:38:06,875
What if he had shot you?

639
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:10,333
Sir…

640
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:12,666
I think you're in a hurry.

641
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:14,000
You may leave.

642
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,291
Hey, put the lady back in the van.

643
00:38:17,916 --> 00:38:20,958
Brother, there's no need.
I can get in there by myself.

644
00:38:21,541 --> 00:38:22,875
It was all a part of the plan, right?

645
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,875
You're up to something.

646
00:38:28,041 --> 00:38:31,000
He has been screaming a lot.
We'll take the corner seat.

647
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,458
Could you please drop us on the way?

648
00:38:35,875 --> 00:38:38,166
-You don't want him to scream, right?
-Yes.

649
00:38:39,541 --> 00:38:41,333
Die! Die, idiot!

650
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:44,916
You're doomed!

651
00:38:48,833 --> 00:38:49,875
Step aside.

652
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:08,000
Hey, you knocked him out with such ease.

653
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:09,833
I have to present him in an hour.

654
00:39:10,875 --> 00:39:13,291
One hour is difficult. He'll regain
consciousness in two hours.

655
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:16,541
And if he doesn't, then
call me at 9445471051.

656
00:39:16,708 --> 00:39:17,791
I'll tell you what to do.

657
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,375
-Hey, Killi, did you note it down?
-You didn't?

658
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:22,083
Note it down, you dimwit!

659
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:24,958
Hey!

660
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,958
What?

661
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:36,458
-Do you know to read?
-I do.

662
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:40,666
Do you have some
medicine for hair loss?

663
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:44,166
Just say yes or no.

664
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,541
Why are you glaring at me?

665
00:39:46,291 --> 00:39:47,291
Am I?

666
00:39:54,583 --> 00:39:57,166
-They beat us to a pulp!
-Are you alright?

667
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:58,416
Shall I show you my rear?

668
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,875
Kamalakannan! Kamesh! Pratap!

669
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:03,916
The three of you,
get over here and wait!

670
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:05,333
Oh, God!

671
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:09,083
-Why did you call us?
-What's it, brother?

672
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:11,125
The AC wants to apologize to you guys.

673
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:13,166
He doesn't have to apologize.

674
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:14,875
Tell him that I've forgiven him.

675
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,625
Hey! If AC is making an
apology, you gotta take it!

676
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:20,208
If you don't, they'll take you
back in there and thrash you!

677
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:21,458
Do you wanna risk it?

678
00:40:21,791 --> 00:40:22,833
Get inside!

679
00:40:24,583 --> 00:40:28,333
Do you have a license for that gun?

680
00:40:29,125 --> 00:40:30,125
License?

681
00:40:30,416 --> 00:40:33,291
Isn't it illegal to have
a gun without a license?

682
00:40:33,708 --> 00:40:36,166
Do you think it's legal to kidnap
the commissioner's daughter?

683
00:40:36,875 --> 00:40:39,625
Until we find Chinnu,
everything we do is illegal.

684
00:40:42,583 --> 00:40:43,875
How much did you score in the 10th grade?

685
00:40:44,916 --> 00:40:45,833
I get it.

686
00:40:46,041 --> 00:40:48,416
I shouldn't ask any questions, right?

687
00:41:07,458 --> 00:41:08,541
How long do we have to wait?

688
00:41:08,708 --> 00:41:10,000
Why are they still here?

689
00:41:10,375 --> 00:41:12,458
Sir, we'll leave from here
once you apologize.

690
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:14,291
Sir, look at their arrogance!

691
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:17,500
Their demand is that you and your
family have to apologize to them!

692
00:41:17,625 --> 00:41:19,625
They won't leave the station
until you do so!

693
00:41:19,708 --> 00:41:22,583
This guy is especially stubborn!
He has been asking about you.

694
00:41:25,458 --> 00:41:26,541
You want me to apologize?

695
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:33,875
Did you see how he pushed
that cupboard on to me?

696
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:41,208
Sir, please get in.
I'll take you to the hospital.

697
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,208
Hey, we didn't ask for your help.

698
00:41:43,291 --> 00:41:46,208
-You three look wiped-out.
-Pratap! Kamalakannan! Kamesh!

699
00:41:46,291 --> 00:41:48,000
Why is he calling out our names again?

700
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:50,541
Get over here! The IG
wants to apologize to you guys.

701
00:41:51,666 --> 00:41:53,125
Hey, get in the van!

702
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:54,291
Brother, please scoot over.

703
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:35,125
Sir, please have some coconut water.

704
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:37,750
Who are you?

705
00:42:38,458 --> 00:42:39,750
I'm Navneet.

706
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:41,083
Navneet?

707
00:42:41,708 --> 00:42:42,916
Are you the Prime Minister?

708
00:42:43,416 --> 00:42:44,583
I'm the girl's father.

709
00:42:45,791 --> 00:42:46,958
Please drink this.

710
00:42:50,375 --> 00:42:51,750
This girl's name is Priyanka.

711
00:42:52,791 --> 00:42:54,958
Last Wednesday at 12:00 p.m.

712
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:58,791
she was kidnapped when she was
leaving from St. Francis Xavier School.

713
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:01,416
Oh, no! Who the hell was it?

714
00:43:01,958 --> 00:43:04,833
We tracked down cell phones
of all the kidnappers in the city…

715
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:08,625
and your cell phone signals were
close to the tower near the school.

716
00:43:09,166 --> 00:43:12,000
So, one among the three of you
has kidnapped this girl.

717
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:17,166
If you confess to the crime…

718
00:43:19,458 --> 00:43:22,000
I'll put back the kidneys that
I removed from your bodies.

719
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:24,083
I don't get it.

720
00:43:27,625 --> 00:43:31,583
I'll return your kidneys, and
stitch it back into your bodies.

721
00:43:32,333 --> 00:43:35,083
Did you just say that
you took our kidneys?

722
00:43:35,666 --> 00:43:36,708
What did he remove?

723
00:43:37,916 --> 00:43:39,166
He removed our kidneys.

724
00:43:39,291 --> 00:43:40,625
That's it, right?

725
00:43:40,916 --> 00:43:42,625
He didn't take our phones
or wallets, right?

726
00:43:44,083 --> 00:43:47,250
You buffoon! Don't you
know what a kidney is?

727
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,791
We have two kidneys.
He has taken just one.

728
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:53,875
We can live with the one we still have.

729
00:43:54,125 --> 00:43:56,750
Listen, man. We are drunkards.

730
00:43:57,083 --> 00:43:58,875
Even four kidneys
won't be enough for us.

731
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:01,208
How will you live with just one kidney?

732
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:03,666
Hey, stop joking now.

733
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:05,083
You bloody…

734
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:08,166
Please don't panic.

735
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:10,750
Your stitches will
slowly start to come off.

736
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:13,250
I think one has already snapped.

737
00:44:14,958 --> 00:44:16,583
Two more snaps and you're dead!

738
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:20,333
I don't understand anything.

739
00:44:21,416 --> 00:44:25,041
For the last three days, I've been getting
flogged for the things I didn't do.

740
00:44:25,291 --> 00:44:29,166
Now you've removed our kidneys
and you're blackmailing us.

741
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,000
Don't be scared.

742
00:44:31,666 --> 00:44:32,791
It's very simple.

743
00:44:33,458 --> 00:44:35,625
Which one of you has kidnapped the girl?

744
00:44:36,083 --> 00:44:37,625
If you confess to the abduction,

745
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,208
I'll plant the kidneys
back into your bodies.

746
00:44:40,625 --> 00:44:42,208
You'll plant them back?!

747
00:44:42,791 --> 00:44:43,875
Sir…

748
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:47,708
I kidnap children from poor families…

749
00:44:48,083 --> 00:44:51,291
and sell them to rich couples
who can't have children.

750
00:44:51,416 --> 00:44:54,333
Sir, a lot of kids have become
millionaires because of me.

751
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:56,250
Sir, I'm only doing social service.

752
00:44:56,333 --> 00:44:57,666
Do you think you're God?

753
00:44:57,916 --> 00:44:58,958
Nincompoop!

754
00:44:59,458 --> 00:45:01,958
Don't think that they'll
commemorate you with a statue.

755
00:45:02,125 --> 00:45:05,166
Listen, I have no idea about these two.

756
00:45:05,291 --> 00:45:06,875
But I didn't kidnap her.

757
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:08,958
Well, then, prove that you didn't.

758
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:10,333
How?

759
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:12,708
What were you doing
on that day at that time?

760
00:45:12,791 --> 00:45:14,750
I was going home to meet my wife.

761
00:45:16,375 --> 00:45:17,625
Give me your wife's phone number.

762
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:20,583
This is your husband, Pratap.

763
00:45:20,666 --> 00:45:22,333
<i>I know, you pig! What is it?</i>

764
00:45:22,625 --> 00:45:25,166
Where did I come to meet you
on Wednesday afternoon?

765
00:45:25,333 --> 00:45:27,416
<i>You came where I was waiting for you.</i>

766
00:45:27,666 --> 00:45:28,916
Yes, but mention the place.

767
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,083
<i>Hey! Don't you know the place?</i>
<i>How did you even get there?</i>

768
00:45:32,583 --> 00:45:35,333
I would rather live with one kidney
than live with you!

769
00:45:37,625 --> 00:45:38,666
Where were you?

770
00:45:38,791 --> 00:45:40,250
I was drinking with a friend.

771
00:45:40,458 --> 00:45:41,791
Give me that friend's phone number.

772
00:45:42,083 --> 00:45:44,166
90031…

773
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:45,500
You guys still have time.

774
00:45:46,333 --> 00:45:49,416
If one among you agrees to the crime…

775
00:45:50,041 --> 00:45:51,916
I'll return your kidneys and let you go.

776
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,166
If you don't, I'll take
the other kidney as well.

777
00:45:54,458 --> 00:45:55,458
Understood?

778
00:45:56,208 --> 00:45:57,250
Sir!

779
00:45:59,875 --> 00:46:01,041
I kidnapped her.

780
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:03,541
Please forgive me.

781
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,291
Sir, please give us back our daughter!

782
00:46:06,375 --> 00:46:08,291
Brother, please give us back our daughter!

783
00:46:08,958 --> 00:46:11,250
Sir, at least tell us where she is!

784
00:46:11,541 --> 00:46:12,791
-Please, brother!
-Please, sir!

785
00:46:12,875 --> 00:46:15,750
Sorry, I don't have
your daughter with me.

786
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,833
-I handed her over to someone else.
-Oh, my God!

787
00:46:17,916 --> 00:46:19,875
-To whom?
-I have no idea.

788
00:46:20,375 --> 00:46:22,750
If there's a demand, they'll call me.

789
00:46:22,833 --> 00:46:24,541
They'll give me a location for the drop.

790
00:46:24,875 --> 00:46:27,208
And then, they'll pay up
and take the girl from me.

791
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:31,875
Tell them that you'll return the money
and ask them to return the girl.

792
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:33,958
They won't give her back.

793
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:36,125
We can't even talk to them.

794
00:46:37,375 --> 00:46:39,458
Come on! Stop pleading with him!

795
00:46:39,625 --> 00:46:41,875
Just shoot him if he doesn't cooperate.

796
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:43,875
They'll immediately return the girl.

797
00:46:43,958 --> 00:46:44,916
Hey!

798
00:46:45,083 --> 00:46:47,916
If you threaten them, they'll ask you
to shoot me and they'll hang up on you.

799
00:46:48,208 --> 00:46:49,041
Loser!

800
00:46:49,125 --> 00:46:52,875
Doctor… call them and tell them
that you have another girl for sale.

801
00:46:53,083 --> 00:46:55,541
Ask them to come and take her.
They won't refuse.

802
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:02,458
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Brother, I have a girl for sale.

803
00:47:02,666 --> 00:47:05,000
She's around ten or eleven
years old. Are you interested?

804
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:06,791
<i>Didn't you sell one girl</i>
<i>just the day before yesterday?</i>

805
00:47:06,875 --> 00:47:08,166
<i>And you got another one already?</i>

806
00:47:08,375 --> 00:47:11,083
<i>At this rate, you won't spare</i>
<i>even one girl in this city.</i>

807
00:47:11,333 --> 00:47:12,458
<i>You're a great kidnapper!</i>

808
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:15,250
<i>From now on, you're not just Kannan.</i>
<i>You're Kidnapper Kannan!</i>

809
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:18,000
<i>Fine, I'll tell you tomorrow</i>
<i>where to come.</i>

810
00:47:18,083 --> 00:47:19,000
Okay.

811
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,166
Look, I have 15 years
of experience in this field.

812
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:26,333
Now return my kidney
and I'll be on my way.

813
00:47:26,625 --> 00:47:27,625
No, brother.

814
00:47:27,791 --> 00:47:29,625
You're more experienced in this matter.

815
00:47:29,833 --> 00:47:32,791
So, you better stick around
until we find Chinnu.

816
00:47:32,958 --> 00:47:35,375
-And your kidney will be with him.
-With him?

817
00:47:36,458 --> 00:47:38,791
Hey, are you kidding me?

818
00:47:39,291 --> 00:47:42,083
You promised to return my
kidney if I gave you an idea.

819
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:44,208
Will you take my idea
and keep my kidney as well?

820
00:47:44,291 --> 00:47:46,458
As if you're a genius
for us to celebrate you!

821
00:47:46,833 --> 00:47:48,125
Hey!

822
00:47:48,791 --> 00:47:52,208
If you don't stop rambling,
I'll flush your kidney down the toilet!

823
00:47:52,291 --> 00:47:53,375
Are you insane?

824
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,166
You're capable of doing that.

825
00:47:55,333 --> 00:47:57,958
By the way, you told them
that you had another girl.

826
00:47:58,291 --> 00:47:59,625
-Do you have one?
-No!

827
00:48:00,625 --> 00:48:02,000
-She's right here.
-What?

828
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:06,625
What you've done to me is unfair!

829
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,541
You obviously can't pull
off Kamal Haasan's look.

830
00:48:08,625 --> 00:48:09,458
Sir!

831
00:48:10,625 --> 00:48:11,583
Please don't bother.

832
00:48:12,083 --> 00:48:14,166
Have you practiced
to use the injection?

833
00:48:14,375 --> 00:48:15,833
Why don't you teach me again?

834
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:23,958
Look closely, sir.

835
00:48:24,625 --> 00:48:27,041
One, the needle should pierce well.

836
00:48:27,708 --> 00:48:29,666
Two, the drug should enter the body.

837
00:48:31,125 --> 00:48:33,000
One, two.

838
00:48:33,416 --> 00:48:36,125
-One, two.
-Well, that's easy!

839
00:48:36,541 --> 00:48:38,583
Give me that. It's no big deal.

840
00:48:50,916 --> 00:48:51,875
What about the driver?

841
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,333
Driver!

842
00:48:53,666 --> 00:48:54,500
Oh, God!

843
00:48:54,916 --> 00:48:57,125
I'm sure this scatterbrain
won't do it right.

844
00:48:57,208 --> 00:48:58,791
-I know.
-What did you say?

845
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,500
Well, you're wearing pigtails.
If we add flowers…

846
00:49:10,208 --> 00:49:11,250
-Sit.
-You took it away.

847
00:49:36,458 --> 00:49:38,208
Hey, what an awful face!

848
00:49:40,166 --> 00:49:42,083
What the hell are you
spraying on my face?

849
00:49:49,791 --> 00:49:51,458
You kept dodging
when I tried to jab you!

850
00:49:51,583 --> 00:49:52,625
How dare you mock me!

851
00:49:52,708 --> 00:49:55,083
Hey, you didn't do it right,
and you're blaming him!

852
00:49:55,166 --> 00:49:56,666
Don't knock him too hard.
He might forget everything.

853
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:57,916
Hey, doctor, that girl…

854
00:49:59,708 --> 00:50:02,125
Doctor, ask him where
the girl is right now.

855
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,250
The girl is not with me, sir.

856
00:50:04,875 --> 00:50:07,000
I gave her away to someone else.

857
00:50:07,875 --> 00:50:08,791
Who is that?

858
00:50:12,666 --> 00:50:14,291
Hey, that's such an awful face!

859
00:50:14,541 --> 00:50:15,958
We can never do
business with this face.

860
00:50:18,791 --> 00:50:20,416
Is my face not worth the business?

861
00:50:20,541 --> 00:50:22,708
Do you expect me to abduct
Trisha to run your business?

862
00:50:22,833 --> 00:50:23,666
Bhagat!

863
00:50:24,208 --> 00:50:25,666
He's pissing me off!

864
00:50:27,333 --> 00:50:29,750
Call up the person
who has the girl now.

865
00:50:30,291 --> 00:50:33,791
Sir, we can't reach them
over the phone.

866
00:50:34,541 --> 00:50:35,458
Then?

867
00:50:35,541 --> 00:50:37,583
They call us when required.

868
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,875
They inquire about the availability.

869
00:50:40,666 --> 00:50:44,333
And if we have the girls,
they fix a place and time.

870
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,416
At that specified time,

871
00:50:46,708 --> 00:50:50,125
we ought to take the
girls and drop them off.

872
00:50:50,458 --> 00:50:51,916
What else do you know about them?

873
00:50:52,708 --> 00:50:54,875
Sir, they're very dangerous.

874
00:50:55,875 --> 00:50:58,083
They don't feel any remorse, sir.

875
00:52:52,291 --> 00:52:53,875
-What is it?
-Brother…

876
00:52:54,958 --> 00:52:56,291
Chinnu does that too.

877
00:52:56,833 --> 00:53:00,541
She likes to lick
Horlicks out of her hand.

878
00:53:02,625 --> 00:53:04,291
When I saw you do the same…

879
00:53:05,166 --> 00:53:07,375
I remembered Chinnu.

880
00:53:09,125 --> 00:53:11,041
I'm sure you won't
remove Chinnu's kidney.

881
00:53:11,625 --> 00:53:12,833
Stop that drama.

882
00:53:13,625 --> 00:53:14,791
Go away and do your work.

883
00:53:19,166 --> 00:53:21,041
<i>-Do you have a girl?</i>
-Yes, I do.

884
00:53:21,166 --> 00:53:22,708
<i>Friday night, 11 o'clock.</i>

885
00:53:23,041 --> 00:53:24,875
<i>-Koyembedu bus stand.</i>
-Okay, sir.

886
00:54:15,375 --> 00:54:17,166
Sir, what are you doing?

887
00:54:17,625 --> 00:54:18,708
I'm taking my suitcase.

888
00:54:18,791 --> 00:54:20,875
Dear, what are you doing
over there? Come here.

889
00:54:21,166 --> 00:54:22,083
Sir, take your hands off.

890
00:54:22,583 --> 00:54:24,500
Madam, please stand near your suitcase.

891
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,458
Sir, this is our suitcase. Let it go.

892
00:54:27,791 --> 00:54:31,166
When we bumped into each other,
our suitcases got swapped.

893
00:54:31,333 --> 00:54:33,000
Hey, don't piss me off, man!

894
00:54:33,375 --> 00:54:35,416
Show some respect.
Don't be rude.

895
00:54:35,541 --> 00:54:36,958
Dad, please open the suitcase.

896
00:54:37,041 --> 00:54:38,375
We'll know whose it is.

897
00:54:39,125 --> 00:54:41,125
Sir, please stop meddling.

898
00:54:42,291 --> 00:54:43,708
I'm not meddling.

899
00:54:45,541 --> 00:54:47,625
-Let's just call the police and settle it.
-That will be nice.

900
00:54:48,791 --> 00:54:50,916
Listen, if they claim it's their suitcase…

901
00:54:51,333 --> 00:54:53,375
then let them just take it.
Please go ahead, sir.

902
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:57,208
It's funny that I need your
permission to take my suitcase!

903
00:54:57,291 --> 00:54:58,250
Please leave, madam.

904
00:54:58,625 --> 00:55:00,541
Let's go, dear.
You may go, madam.

905
00:55:31,166 --> 00:55:33,208
I have to wait for the practice.

906
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:37,375
Hello.

907
00:56:12,041 --> 00:56:14,291
Varun, we'll enter
the tunnel in ten seconds.

908
00:56:14,416 --> 00:56:15,541
<i>Everyone, please be ready.</i>

909
00:56:49,208 --> 00:56:50,083
Hey!

910
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,083
What the hell!

911
00:57:23,416 --> 00:57:24,958
That is not my problem.

912
00:57:31,666 --> 00:57:33,250
Hey, be careful.

913
00:58:24,333 --> 00:58:26,750
Watch and learn.
I have 15 years of training.

914
00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:29,208
You can jab the needle now.

915
00:58:29,708 --> 00:58:31,416
Come on, lie down here.

916
00:58:58,916 --> 00:59:00,791
Who switched on the lights
before we could jab him?

917
00:59:02,583 --> 00:59:03,583
Oh, God!

918
00:59:21,083 --> 00:59:23,250
<i>Varun! Varun, can you hear me?</i>

919
00:59:23,833 --> 00:59:25,583
<i>We'll hit the next tunnel in 60 seconds.</i>

920
00:59:26,583 --> 00:59:28,541
The next tunnel is 60 seconds away.

921
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:31,166
What do we do
for the next 60 seconds?

922
00:59:34,875 --> 00:59:35,916
Fight!

923
00:59:52,666 --> 00:59:54,875
Do you want to find Chinnu or not?

924
00:59:58,833 --> 01:00:00,125
Oh, no!

925
01:00:01,291 --> 01:00:02,958
Oh, my God!

926
01:00:04,375 --> 01:00:05,666
I'll save you all.

927
01:00:06,416 --> 01:00:07,708
Hey!

928
01:00:07,875 --> 01:00:10,000
I'm going to knock him out.

929
01:00:10,083 --> 01:00:12,000
-Hit him!
-Idiot.

930
01:00:13,916 --> 01:00:14,958
-Sorry, dear.
-Go!

931
01:00:15,041 --> 01:00:16,250
Hey, baldie! Stand still!

932
01:00:16,333 --> 01:00:17,375
Oh, my!

933
01:00:20,291 --> 01:00:21,291
Sorry.

934
01:00:21,541 --> 01:00:23,333
Oh, no! That was a strong punch!

935
01:00:26,041 --> 01:00:27,000
Oh, God!

936
01:00:37,875 --> 01:00:39,250
Hey, baldie!

937
01:00:39,958 --> 01:00:41,208
-Hey, Pratap!
-What is it?

938
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,333
-I saved you, Pratap.
-Are you serious, Bhagat?

939
01:00:44,416 --> 01:00:46,250
Oh, my! Your ear is bleeding.

940
01:01:04,541 --> 01:01:07,291
Damn it! Hey, do you
see what's happening?

941
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:08,958
Why do we even have to endure this?

942
01:01:09,125 --> 01:01:11,125
You could have
just had another baby.

943
01:01:11,291 --> 01:01:13,833
You're killing my mother's son
to save your daughter.

944
01:01:13,916 --> 01:01:15,541
Who will answer my mother?

945
01:01:16,041 --> 01:01:18,083
Give me your address.
I'll go and inform her.

946
01:01:18,166 --> 01:01:20,250
You won't be able to speak
if I break your jaw!

947
01:01:24,541 --> 01:01:25,666
Bhagat!

948
01:01:25,791 --> 01:01:27,916
-Bhagat!
-Doctor, I'm here! Who should I beat up?

949
01:01:28,708 --> 01:01:29,750
Oh, no!

950
01:01:30,541 --> 01:01:31,791
It's pitch-dark in here!

951
01:01:33,083 --> 01:01:34,791
How did they manage to
thrash people in the dark?

952
01:01:36,583 --> 01:01:37,666
Doctor!

953
01:01:39,208 --> 01:01:40,625
Please return my goggles!

954
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,500
Doctor, please ask them
to switch on the lights.

955
01:01:48,583 --> 01:01:49,583
Oh, my God!

956
01:01:54,208 --> 01:01:55,250
Pratap…

957
01:01:57,958 --> 01:01:58,958
Pratap!

958
01:02:00,208 --> 01:02:01,583
Bhagat, keep quiet.

959
01:02:01,833 --> 01:02:04,416
-Pratap…
-Keep quiet, Bhagat.

960
01:02:04,583 --> 01:02:07,708
-Pratap, doctor had called me.
-Good.

961
01:02:08,541 --> 01:02:10,416
I went to him
thinking it was an emergency.

962
01:02:11,541 --> 01:02:12,833
He took away my night-vision goggles.

963
01:02:13,416 --> 01:02:14,291
Bhagat!

964
01:02:14,875 --> 01:02:16,958
You were saying something, and you
took away my night-vision goggles.

965
01:02:17,291 --> 01:02:19,541
It's really dark here.
Please give it back.

966
01:02:22,958 --> 01:02:23,791
Who's that?

967
01:02:24,833 --> 01:02:25,791
Excuse me.

968
01:02:29,916 --> 01:02:32,000
I know everyone is seated here.

969
01:02:32,333 --> 01:02:34,625
I can't see at the moment,
but I'm sure you can see me.

970
01:02:35,208 --> 01:02:36,625
You can hold my hand and guide me.

971
01:02:36,791 --> 01:02:40,208
Instead, you guys are keeping mum
and holding your breath.

972
01:02:40,375 --> 01:02:43,458
This isn't fair.
Please have some mercy on me.

973
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:44,833
Hel…

974
01:02:45,333 --> 01:02:46,208
Baldie!

975
01:02:46,416 --> 01:02:48,916
Sorry, sir. I have
nothing to do with that kid.

976
01:02:49,958 --> 01:02:50,875
It's just a rod!

977
01:02:52,333 --> 01:02:55,500
Just because I'm helpless,
you're taking advantage of me.

978
01:02:58,166 --> 01:02:59,125
Vadapalani!

979
01:03:04,333 --> 01:03:05,458
They switched on the lights.

980
01:03:06,541 --> 01:03:07,416
Is it interval now?

981
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:18,208
You have the child. Give her
back to us and I'll let you live.

982
01:03:18,791 --> 01:03:20,791
If you don't, I'll slit your throat.

983
01:03:21,333 --> 01:03:24,791
Do you think we'll spill the beans
because you're threatening to kill?

984
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:29,083
Alvin, if he kills me, then
you too slit your throat and die.

985
01:03:31,083 --> 01:03:32,500
Don't give up the girl at any cost.

986
01:03:34,666 --> 01:03:37,166
Do you think he'll kill himself
just because you asked him to?

987
01:03:38,083 --> 01:03:39,875
The two of you have a great bond.

988
01:03:41,333 --> 01:03:43,250
Danny, open the doors.

989
01:03:52,125 --> 01:03:54,291
-I won't let go of you.
-Let go!

990
01:03:59,666 --> 01:04:01,125
Melvin!

991
01:04:04,458 --> 01:04:06,000
Melvin!

992
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:34,708
Hey!

993
01:04:36,166 --> 01:04:38,333
Why are you wailing
just for just two stitches?

994
01:04:39,291 --> 01:04:41,833
He ripped my flesh, removed
my kidney and bottled it up.

995
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,666
But I'm keeping calm, right?
Be calm, man!

996
01:04:44,083 --> 01:04:45,666
He's wailing like a buffalo.

997
01:04:48,125 --> 01:04:50,416
Sister, please pass me some water.

998
01:04:51,791 --> 01:04:52,916
Oh, my God!

999
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:56,541
You ave a black eye!

1000
01:04:57,208 --> 01:04:59,166
You refused to get
married to him, right?

1001
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:02,166
Now no one will be
willing to marry you.

1002
01:05:02,250 --> 01:05:03,291
That includes me.

1003
01:05:13,208 --> 01:05:16,041
Doctor, even if we
end up finding Chinnu…

1004
01:05:16,208 --> 01:05:18,291
you've turned us into
people beyond recognition.

1005
01:05:18,625 --> 01:05:20,000
Educated people are always dangerous.

1006
01:05:21,458 --> 01:05:22,958
It will be fine in three to four days.

1007
01:05:23,291 --> 01:05:24,791
How will I present myself until then?

1008
01:05:24,916 --> 01:05:26,333
As if people have been noticing you.

1009
01:05:33,708 --> 01:05:36,791
Doctor, could you please
pass me some water?

1010
01:05:36,875 --> 01:05:38,416
I've been asking everyone
for the last one hour.

1011
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,583
Get lost! Psycho… doctor.

1012
01:05:43,208 --> 01:05:44,333
Psycho doctor!

1013
01:05:48,666 --> 01:05:51,791
I thought you would remove his kidney
and extract information on Chinnu,

1014
01:05:51,875 --> 01:05:53,041
but you're feeding him!

1015
01:05:53,333 --> 01:05:55,125
His brother is more important
to him than his kidney.

1016
01:05:55,333 --> 01:05:58,208
He'll confess very soon.
You just go and tend to the injured.

1017
01:06:32,291 --> 01:06:34,291
<i>Alvin! Alvin!</i>

1018
01:06:35,041 --> 01:06:37,375
<i>Where are you?</i>
<i>Please say something.</i>

1019
01:06:37,791 --> 01:06:39,333
<i>Tell me, Alvin! Where are you?</i>

1020
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:41,541
<i>I've been feeling</i>
<i>really scared without you.</i>

1021
01:06:42,541 --> 01:06:43,791
<i>Let's give up that girl.</i>

1022
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:45,541
<i>Let's give them back their child.</i>

1023
01:06:45,833 --> 01:06:47,750
<i>Alvin, please say something.</i>

1024
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:51,375
Pass me that phone.

1025
01:06:54,625 --> 01:06:55,916
I will give up the girl.

1026
01:07:37,333 --> 01:07:39,875
Tell me, which one
of these girls is your child?

1027
01:07:48,791 --> 01:07:50,500
-Tell me, who is it?
-<i>Hey, there's Chinnu!</i>

1028
01:07:50,583 --> 01:07:51,916
-<i>Chinnu!</i>
-Which one?

1029
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,166
Hurry up! We don't have much time.

1030
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:55,250
-Tell him Chinnu is right behind him.
-Chinnu…

1031
01:07:55,333 --> 01:07:56,166
Come on!

1032
01:07:56,250 --> 01:07:58,500
-Chinnu is right there.
-<i>Hurry up. Tell me fast!</i>

1033
01:07:59,666 --> 01:08:01,083
<i>I don't have much time. Hurry up!</i>

1034
01:08:01,166 --> 01:08:02,666
-Chinnu!
-Please tell him.

1035
01:08:03,625 --> 01:08:05,500
-I want you to give up all the girls.
-What?

1036
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:08,000
All the girls?!

1037
01:08:08,083 --> 01:08:09,666
I got permission only to give up one girl.

1038
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,458
I can only take one girl out of here.

1039
01:08:12,166 --> 01:08:13,541
Now don't waste time
and make up your mind.

1040
01:08:13,625 --> 01:08:16,166
-Please, sir, that's my daughter.
-<i>Come on, don't waste my time!</i>

1041
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:17,625
<i>-Tell me fast.</i>
-Chinnu!

1042
01:08:18,166 --> 01:08:20,166
I want all the girls.
Release all of them.

1043
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:22,541
What is wrong with you?
We just want Chinnu to be released.

1044
01:08:22,625 --> 01:08:25,000
Just ask them to release Chinnu.
Don't be crazy!

1045
01:08:25,083 --> 01:08:27,791
Sir, he's ready to release one girl.

1046
01:08:27,958 --> 01:08:29,791
Please ask him to release Chinnu.

1047
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,958
In the next ten minutes, this
container will be dispatched to Goa.

1048
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:34,166
-Hurry up!
-Sir… please!

1049
01:08:34,291 --> 01:08:36,916
-Please, sir…
-Come on, hurry up!

1050
01:08:37,166 --> 01:08:38,041
Bhagat!

1051
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:58,958
Hey!

1052
01:09:03,125 --> 01:09:04,041
<i>Stop it!</i>

1053
01:09:04,416 --> 01:09:06,916
<i>-Stop!</i>
-Give up all the girls.

1054
01:09:07,375 --> 01:09:12,375
You can kill me if you want,
but he can't give up all the girls.

1055
01:09:12,875 --> 01:09:15,166
That container is not under our control!

1056
01:09:15,666 --> 01:09:17,291
-Sir!
-Son, don't be unreasonable.

1057
01:09:17,416 --> 01:09:19,791
-Sir…
-We have worked so hard to find Chinnu.

1058
01:09:19,916 --> 01:09:22,083
Now she's right in front of our eyes,
and we're not doing anything.

1059
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:24,791
You don't consider
the other girls as human beings?

1060
01:09:27,166 --> 01:09:29,416
Can you give up all the seven girls…

1061
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:32,166
or not?

1062
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:34,333
<i>I can't.</i>

1063
01:09:46,041 --> 01:09:48,250
What should I do to
have all the girls released?

1064
01:09:48,666 --> 01:09:51,000
If you wish to free all of them,
you'll have to go to Goa.

1065
01:09:53,083 --> 01:09:54,000
-Hey!
-Sir!

1066
01:09:54,458 --> 01:09:56,333
Why do we have to
listen to you all the time?

1067
01:09:56,416 --> 01:09:57,750
Chinnu is all that matters to us!

1068
01:09:57,833 --> 01:09:59,875
We really don't care what
happens to the other girls!

1069
01:09:59,958 --> 01:10:02,000
I don't need your permission
to release that guy.

1070
01:10:02,083 --> 01:10:03,000
Hey!

1071
01:10:04,625 --> 01:10:06,291
You shouldn't be shouting unnecessarily.

1072
01:10:06,791 --> 01:10:08,958
I'll hack you to pieces
and put you inside a glass jar.

1073
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:13,500
Mini…

1074
01:10:14,125 --> 01:10:15,333
tell me what we should do.

1075
01:10:15,708 --> 01:10:17,333
Why don't we just get Chinnu released?

1076
01:10:18,041 --> 01:10:21,958
Oh! So, all your love and affection
is limited to your family.

1077
01:10:22,125 --> 01:10:23,250
You're selfish.

1078
01:10:24,041 --> 01:10:26,250
You don't care what happens
to the other kids.

1079
01:10:26,833 --> 01:10:28,666
You're all talk and no action.

1080
01:10:29,875 --> 01:10:30,875
Aren't you ashamed?

1081
01:10:32,791 --> 01:10:34,166
I only care about two things.

1082
01:10:34,583 --> 01:10:37,375
We will either be happy
by saving all the seven girls.

1083
01:10:38,125 --> 01:10:40,708
Or we will die
in the process of saving them.

1084
01:10:41,875 --> 01:10:43,791
That makes you
a compassionate psycho!

1085
01:10:44,125 --> 01:10:46,541
Brother, you've done
a lot for this family.

1086
01:10:46,666 --> 01:10:48,250
Please do us one last favor.

1087
01:10:48,541 --> 01:10:50,375
I can't bear to see my
daughter in this state.

1088
01:10:50,458 --> 01:10:52,666
I'm begging you! Please help us!

1089
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:55,250
Please bring our daughter back!

1090
01:10:55,958 --> 01:10:57,916
Please save our daughter!

1091
01:10:58,583 --> 01:11:01,000
Sir, that's my daughter. Please, sir.

1092
01:11:01,208 --> 01:11:04,208
-It's our Chinnu, sir. Please help us.
-Okay.

1093
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:07,791
I'll give you another option
that might make you happy.

1094
01:11:24,083 --> 01:11:27,041
I won't be at peace if
I abandon the other six girls.

1095
01:11:28,125 --> 01:11:30,916
So, one of you can pick up
that gun and shoot me.

1096
01:11:31,541 --> 01:11:33,666
And then, you can take back
your daughter from them.

1097
01:11:34,833 --> 01:11:35,958
God bless you.

1098
01:11:42,333 --> 01:11:44,958
Son… what's wrong with you?

1099
01:11:46,416 --> 01:11:47,625
Please don't waste time.

1100
01:11:47,833 --> 01:11:48,750
Hurry up.

1101
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:11,333
I'm sure this gun is unloaded.

1102
01:12:15,458 --> 01:12:17,666
That's why you're being so cool about it.

1103
01:12:22,375 --> 01:12:24,250
Instead of going to
prison for killing you…

1104
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:27,833
I'd rather go to Goa.

1105
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:37,458
This is the plan, and this
is how it's going to be done.

1106
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:42,375
Your plan maybe extensive,
but we don't have enough manpower.

1107
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:44,083
And this guy is a troublemaker!

1108
01:12:44,166 --> 01:12:45,583
What do we do about others?

1109
01:12:45,666 --> 01:12:47,625
Fold your legs. The doctor
might perform a surgery on you.

1110
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:51,208
We'll find someone along the way.

1111
01:12:52,125 --> 01:12:54,416
As if people are lining up
out there to save the child.

1112
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:55,875
No one will agree to it.

1113
01:12:57,958 --> 01:12:58,958
I agree they won't.

1114
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:01,166
We should make them
an offer they can't refuse.

1115
01:13:01,291 --> 01:13:02,750
But we need a scapegoat.

1116
01:13:10,416 --> 01:13:12,291
He is not your father.

1117
01:13:15,083 --> 01:13:17,291
And you are not her husband.

1118
01:13:19,208 --> 01:13:21,416
And this woman is not her sister-in-law.

1119
01:13:22,208 --> 01:13:24,208
To sum up, you people
are not of the same family.

1120
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,916
You're pretending to be a family
and you're kidnapping kids.

1121
01:13:31,416 --> 01:13:34,250
Why is everyone injured
in some way or the other?

1122
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:37,250
We met with an accident
last week during a kidnapping.

1123
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:38,916
Who was driving?

1124
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,666
Don't you have any sense?

1125
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,958
There were so many women in the car.

1126
01:13:45,458 --> 01:13:46,833
You should've been more careful.

1127
01:13:49,333 --> 01:13:50,250
Look over there.

1128
01:13:51,416 --> 01:13:54,458
A beautiful face has been scarred.

1129
01:13:56,916 --> 01:13:59,125
You should kick him out of the house.

1130
01:13:59,708 --> 01:14:01,375
We tried, but he doesn't leave.

1131
01:14:01,916 --> 01:14:04,833
You people are injured.
Go over there and settle down.

1132
01:14:08,375 --> 01:14:10,416
So, tell me.
What can I do for you?

1133
01:14:10,916 --> 01:14:12,416
According to the information he received,

1134
01:14:12,541 --> 01:14:14,583
a man has kidnapped a lot of girls
in Goa and taken them hostage.

1135
01:14:14,875 --> 01:14:17,333
If we plan well and rescue them…

1136
01:14:17,708 --> 01:14:21,250
he can't file a police complaint,
and we won't face any issues either.

1137
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:26,833
The total worth
of those girls is 50 crore rupees.

1138
01:14:29,166 --> 01:14:32,125
According to your plan,
we'll be at greater risk.

1139
01:14:32,583 --> 01:14:33,708
What did I tell you?

1140
01:14:34,291 --> 01:14:36,916
They're small-time goons
who just play with sickles.

1141
01:14:37,166 --> 01:14:40,333
They're bound to get nervous if you
discuss a deal worth millions with them.

1142
01:14:41,083 --> 01:14:44,125
A dog can only bark.
But a lion can kill.

1143
01:14:45,458 --> 01:14:47,041
We can't use them to kidnap children.

1144
01:14:47,291 --> 01:14:49,375
We can only use their faces
to scare off children.

1145
01:14:49,666 --> 01:14:50,750
What a waste of time!

1146
01:14:52,791 --> 01:14:55,375
Hey! Don't forget that
you're in my hood!

1147
01:14:55,458 --> 01:14:56,666
-So?
-Sir, please.

1148
01:14:57,583 --> 01:14:58,625
It's okay.

1149
01:15:01,333 --> 01:15:03,625
I usually don't give my word to anyone.

1150
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:07,250
But when I do, I would
risk my life to fulfill it.

1151
01:15:07,625 --> 01:15:09,416
I'll fulfill it even if I'm dead.

1152
01:15:09,958 --> 01:15:11,208
You can't fulfill it if you die.

1153
01:15:11,291 --> 01:15:13,083
-We can only light candles for you.
-Correct!

1154
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:15,125
Hey, you've been giving your
word like it's a piece of cake!

1155
01:15:15,208 --> 01:15:16,458
It's not easy to get beaten up.

1156
01:15:16,541 --> 01:15:17,625
Killi…

1157
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:19,708
I'll rip you apart.

1158
01:15:20,875 --> 01:15:22,666
How do we split the share?

1159
01:15:24,416 --> 01:15:25,333
33%

1160
01:15:25,541 --> 01:15:26,375
33%

1161
01:15:26,666 --> 01:15:27,500
34%

1162
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:28,875
Let's do it this way.

1163
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:30,375
40%

1164
01:15:30,625 --> 01:15:31,541
30%

1165
01:15:31,916 --> 01:15:32,750
30%

1166
01:15:34,416 --> 01:15:38,250
This is just like someone stealing
a story and calling it their own.

1167
01:15:38,583 --> 01:15:41,625
I bring the project to you guys,
and you call the shots?!

1168
01:15:42,166 --> 01:15:44,625
-I'm leaving. This won't work out.
-Sir, please don't get angry.

1169
01:15:44,916 --> 01:15:46,791
-I'll talk to him.
-Carry on.

1170
01:15:48,208 --> 01:15:49,625
Sir, I really don't care about the share.

1171
01:15:49,916 --> 01:15:51,125
This alliance matters the most to me.

1172
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:53,125
I want to use that
for bigger projects in the future.

1173
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,750
So, it will be 20% for me…

1174
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:57,416
40% for you…

1175
01:15:57,583 --> 01:15:58,875
-and 40% for him.
-Wrong!

1176
01:15:59,625 --> 01:16:00,791
Listen to this.

1177
01:16:01,125 --> 01:16:02,375
41%

1178
01:16:02,666 --> 01:16:03,750
21%

1179
01:16:04,166 --> 01:16:05,166
38%

1180
01:16:05,583 --> 01:16:06,416
Hey!

1181
01:16:06,833 --> 01:16:08,500
That's a rather bizarre way
to split the shares!

1182
01:16:08,583 --> 01:16:09,833
I've never heard something like this!

1183
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,750
Dim-witted dweeb!

1184
01:16:12,041 --> 01:16:13,916
-Mr. Pratap! Please, sir!
-Shut up, man!

1185
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,958
God knows if he's splitting shares
or rambling landline numbers!

1186
01:16:16,041 --> 01:16:18,416
-Such bizarre numbers…
-Sir, excuse me.

1187
01:16:23,166 --> 01:16:24,541
Why are you overdoing it?

1188
01:16:24,708 --> 01:16:27,083
If you don't listen to him,
I'll take out your second kidney as well!

1189
01:16:27,166 --> 01:16:31,291
Listen, if I agree to all his terms,
he'll figure out the ruse.

1190
01:16:31,625 --> 01:16:33,833
He will cave in only if we play hardball.

1191
01:16:33,916 --> 01:16:36,208
-That's why I did that.
-Why are you guys arguing?

1192
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:38,083
We know that there's
no actual money involved.

1193
01:16:38,250 --> 01:16:40,958
It doesn't matter even if we
give him 100% of the share.

1194
01:16:41,125 --> 01:16:44,125
-He'll get on board in no time.
-Give him 100% of the share?!

1195
01:16:44,541 --> 01:16:46,208
To give him 100% of the share,

1196
01:16:46,291 --> 01:16:49,125
why are we risking
our lives for this kidnapping?

1197
01:16:49,208 --> 01:16:50,625
Just for charity!

1198
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:52,625
Oh, God! He's incorrigible!

1199
01:16:53,041 --> 01:16:55,958
I'm ready to do anything you ask me to.
Just make sure he's not a part of it.

1200
01:16:58,708 --> 01:17:01,333
I had a word with him.
Your deal is fine with us.

1201
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:04,583
-Ask that girl to say the same.
-Why?

1202
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,875
Mahali's rules will
keep changing with time.

1203
01:17:14,166 --> 01:17:15,125
Wrong!

1204
01:17:15,625 --> 01:17:16,541
I meant that girl.

1205
01:17:20,041 --> 01:17:20,958
Thought so.

1206
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:23,208
He is fond of her.

1207
01:17:25,166 --> 01:17:26,375
You tell me, dear.

1208
01:17:28,666 --> 01:17:31,500
Why are you seeking his permission
as if he's your legal husband?

1209
01:17:32,208 --> 01:17:33,583
What's your name?

1210
01:17:33,833 --> 01:17:34,750
Sumathi.

1211
01:17:35,583 --> 01:17:37,750
For Sumathi, I'm okay with this deal.

1212
01:17:38,375 --> 01:17:39,833
What time are we leaving for Goa?

1213
01:17:40,458 --> 01:17:43,416
GOA

1214
01:18:15,958 --> 01:18:18,333
-Hello?
<i>-I've emailed you a photo.</i>

1215
01:18:18,625 --> 01:18:20,500
<i>The person in that picture</i>
<i>will be at the resort.</i>

1216
01:18:20,916 --> 01:18:23,375
<i>Make sure he doesn't spot</i>
<i>you guys. Be careful.</i>

1217
01:18:23,833 --> 01:18:25,250
Okay.

1218
01:18:26,333 --> 01:18:28,000
He has emailed a photo.

1219
01:18:28,416 --> 01:18:31,291
He has asked us to make sure we
don't get spotted by that person.

1220
01:18:42,666 --> 01:18:43,708
Excuse me.

1221
01:18:44,333 --> 01:18:45,833
I hope I didn't disturb you guys.

1222
01:18:47,666 --> 01:18:48,666
Tamil?

1223
01:18:50,375 --> 01:18:52,041
Are you coming to this
resort for the first time?

1224
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:54,083
Thanks for choosing our resort.

1225
01:18:54,750 --> 01:18:56,291
Goa is a very beautiful place.

1226
01:18:56,791 --> 01:18:59,916
There are many places and things
to see and explore out here.

1227
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:02,250
If you wish to explore something…

1228
01:19:02,541 --> 01:19:04,291
you can contact
the reception anytime.

1229
01:19:04,666 --> 01:19:07,041
And since you're at my
resort for the first time,

1230
01:19:07,291 --> 01:19:08,333
I would like to inform you

1231
01:19:08,416 --> 01:19:11,041
that your breakfast will be
complimentary for the rest of your stay.

1232
01:19:11,125 --> 01:19:13,541
So, please enjoy your
stay with us. Thank you.

1233
01:19:15,916 --> 01:19:18,083
Hi, good morning.
How are you doing?

1234
01:19:36,916 --> 01:19:38,583
-Hello?
<i>-Yeah?</i>

1235
01:19:39,375 --> 01:19:41,708
Actually, he spotted us.

1236
01:19:42,125 --> 01:19:44,208
Wonderful! Now please
hang up for God's sake.

1237
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:45,625
Wait a minute!

1238
01:19:46,583 --> 01:19:50,041
He doesn't seem to be
a bad person like you mentioned.

1239
01:19:50,416 --> 01:19:51,875
He seems like a decent man.

1240
01:19:52,333 --> 01:19:53,541
Also, he's very sweet.

1241
01:19:54,458 --> 01:19:55,458
I hope we're doing the right--

1242
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:57,833
<i>You look like a genius.</i>
<i>But are you really a genius?</i>

1243
01:19:58,166 --> 01:20:00,166
<i>Just follow the plan.</i>
<i>Tonight at 10 o'clock.</i>

1244
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:09,791
Killi, imagine how it would be if
we kidnap Sumathi instead of Mini.

1245
01:20:09,875 --> 01:20:11,833
You'll be happy,
and I'll be pissed off.

1246
01:20:12,083 --> 01:20:14,208
Listen, stick to the doctor's plan.

1247
01:20:14,291 --> 01:20:17,875
When they look at the CCTV footage,
it should look like real kidnapping.

1248
01:20:18,041 --> 01:20:21,458
Wait and watch. I'm going to
grab her by the neck and kidnap her.

1249
01:20:22,541 --> 01:20:23,750
That girl is calling us.

1250
01:20:25,333 --> 01:20:27,916
Hello! It's the big car on your right.

1251
01:20:28,041 --> 01:20:30,125
I can see you. Keep walking.
It's the big car.

1252
01:20:31,625 --> 01:20:34,125
<i>You're heading the wrong way.</i>
<i>Walk towards the car!</i>

1253
01:20:34,333 --> 01:20:36,625
I'm almost there, and you
haven't opened the door yet.

1254
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:39,333
-Hey!
-Come on, Mahali! Nab her!

1255
01:20:39,541 --> 01:20:41,166
Hey, Killi! My pants are stuck.

1256
01:20:49,791 --> 01:20:52,375
Oh, no! My daughter is missing.
Did anyone see her?

1257
01:20:52,833 --> 01:20:54,916
-Mr. Foreigner…
-Check at the reception.

1258
01:20:55,041 --> 01:20:57,208
-have you seen her?
-You people are irresponsible!

1259
01:20:57,291 --> 01:20:59,416
My daughter went
missing from your resort.

1260
01:20:59,625 --> 01:21:01,541
-Sir, please don't panic.
-I'm going to file a police complaint.

1261
01:21:01,625 --> 01:21:04,291
-I want to file a complaint right away!
-Please calm own. We'll take care of it.

1262
01:21:04,416 --> 01:21:05,708
Sir, I can understand.

1263
01:21:06,166 --> 01:21:08,041
Please give us some time.

1264
01:21:08,333 --> 01:21:10,875
How can you ask me for time?
It's my daughter who has gone missing!

1265
01:21:11,083 --> 01:21:12,666
It's imperative that we
file a police complaint!

1266
01:21:12,791 --> 01:21:14,250
Are you going to help me or not?

1267
01:21:26,916 --> 01:21:28,625
Sir, I'm really sorry about this.

1268
01:21:28,875 --> 01:21:31,833
It's not an ordinary thing
for a girl to go missing.

1269
01:21:32,041 --> 01:21:34,208
I can totally understand your pain.

1270
01:21:36,375 --> 01:21:38,125
But please try to
understand my situation.

1271
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:41,625
If you file a police complaint, the name
of my resort will be out in the news.

1272
01:21:41,708 --> 01:21:43,708
And it will ruin my
entire reputation.

1273
01:21:43,791 --> 01:21:45,250
And it will ruin my entire business.

1274
01:21:45,541 --> 01:21:48,000
Sir, just trust me and
give me eight hours.

1275
01:21:48,083 --> 01:21:50,583
I have many friends in
the government and the police department.

1276
01:21:50,750 --> 01:21:54,291
I'll handle this unofficially
and find your daughter, sir.

1277
01:21:54,791 --> 01:21:58,166
Please consider me as your son
and give me some time.

1278
01:22:00,958 --> 01:22:03,291
Sir, it's on the CCTV.

1279
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,041
Yeah, Terry?

1280
01:22:18,458 --> 01:22:20,875
Gabbar, you have six hours. Find them.

1281
01:22:21,291 --> 01:22:22,166
Okay!

1282
01:22:30,208 --> 01:22:33,083
Killi, kidnapping the girl
was not the big task.

1283
01:22:33,416 --> 01:22:35,916
Now they'll take us away
and beat us to a pulp.

1284
01:22:36,083 --> 01:22:40,125
If we bear their thrashing,
we can earn their trust.

1285
01:22:40,208 --> 01:22:41,375
That's what the doctor said.

1286
01:22:41,916 --> 01:22:44,083
Doctor said they would
be here before noon.

1287
01:22:44,208 --> 01:22:45,875
It's 15 minutes past noon,
and no one's here yet!

1288
01:23:02,541 --> 01:23:03,833
Where's the girl? Tell me!

1289
01:23:04,208 --> 01:23:06,541
-Shall I confess, Mahali?
-Don't confess, Killi.

1290
01:23:07,125 --> 01:23:08,208
I've given my word.

1291
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:10,333
For Sumathi!

1292
01:23:10,791 --> 01:23:13,000
You're too old to be
romancing, damn it.

1293
01:23:19,583 --> 01:23:22,875
Terry, if we beat
them more, it'll be fatal.

1294
01:23:23,416 --> 01:23:26,125
They're bloody scoundrels.
Not able to break them.

1295
01:23:29,125 --> 01:23:30,833
Boss, they're
going to start afresh.

1296
01:23:30,916 --> 01:23:32,708
-Get out!
-Sir, please spare us.

1297
01:23:32,791 --> 01:23:35,000
-Please! Sir!
-Oh, no!

1298
01:23:39,625 --> 01:23:40,458
Mahali!

1299
01:23:40,708 --> 01:23:41,541
Oh, God!

1300
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:43,416
Oh, no! Mahali!

1301
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:45,500
Mahali, let's confess it.

1302
01:23:45,583 --> 01:23:47,541
-Don't. Please bear it all.
-Mahali, let's confess.

1303
01:23:47,625 --> 01:23:48,583
-I don't deserve this.
-I've given my word.

1304
01:23:48,666 --> 01:23:50,083
I don't deserve it.

1305
01:23:50,583 --> 01:23:52,208
Oh, God. That's nasty.

1306
01:23:52,375 --> 01:23:55,083
Word! Word! My nose!

1307
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:59,250
-Oh, no!
-Boss, here use this.

1308
01:23:59,375 --> 01:24:01,250
Damn it, he gave
him a box to beat us.

1309
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,125
Oh, God, no!

1310
01:24:24,625 --> 01:24:26,166
Bloody, scoundrel.

1311
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:27,625
-Let go of me.
-Get inside, damn it.

1312
01:24:27,833 --> 01:24:30,083
-Oh, no!
-You wanna try this?

1313
01:24:31,666 --> 01:24:35,416
I appreciate that you're
not confessing it for my sake.

1314
01:24:36,166 --> 01:24:37,125
I love you!

1315
01:24:37,208 --> 01:24:39,833
Damn it, I forgot why
we're getting beaten up.

1316
01:24:40,166 --> 01:24:43,000
-Why don't you give me some clue?
-Hey, give me that knife.

1317
01:24:43,208 --> 01:24:44,541
He's getting a knife.

1318
01:24:44,625 --> 01:24:46,500
-He's bringing a knife, damn it.
-Knife!

1319
01:24:47,333 --> 01:24:49,083
I'll confess. I'll confess.

1320
01:24:49,708 --> 01:24:51,000
I'll confess.

1321
01:24:56,583 --> 01:24:57,666
Ice creams.

1322
01:25:07,333 --> 01:25:08,833
-Welcome, sir.
-Hello.

1323
01:25:10,416 --> 01:25:12,916
-Yes, sir.
-I need to talk to you.

1324
01:25:13,916 --> 01:25:15,041
I don't understand.

1325
01:25:16,541 --> 01:25:19,041
You know Tamil,
right. Shall we talk?

1326
01:25:20,666 --> 01:25:22,625
I can get you anything
that's on the menu.

1327
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:25,166
Vanilla, strawberry,
butterscotch,

1328
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:27,500
vanilla truffle, chocolate
truffle, strawberry mousse.

1329
01:25:28,375 --> 01:25:29,500
Tell me what you want?

1330
01:25:54,666 --> 01:25:57,083
Shut down the shop stating
maintenance and get rid of the customers.

1331
01:25:57,875 --> 01:25:58,791
Come inside.

1332
01:26:05,958 --> 01:26:06,875
What do you want?

1333
01:26:07,833 --> 01:26:10,750
Where's the girl you kidnapped
last night from my resort?

1334
01:26:12,166 --> 01:26:13,708
That girl has been
transferred elsewhere.

1335
01:26:14,125 --> 01:26:15,333
Ask me for something else.

1336
01:26:16,541 --> 01:26:18,208
I can't leave without the girl.

1337
01:26:19,708 --> 01:26:22,125
Like I mentioned, I
can't bring back the girl.

1338
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:23,458
Please leave.

1339
01:26:26,291 --> 01:26:27,125
Hey!

1340
01:26:28,208 --> 01:26:29,791
Sir. Sorry, sir.

1341
01:26:30,166 --> 01:26:33,000
It was a mistake.
Please forgive him.

1342
01:26:36,708 --> 01:26:38,541
Oh, God, no!

1343
01:26:38,875 --> 01:26:40,875
Oh, God, no!

1344
01:26:41,208 --> 01:26:42,041
Hey!

1345
01:26:42,375 --> 01:26:44,166
Oh, God, no!

1346
01:26:44,666 --> 01:26:46,416
-Oh, God, no!
-How dare you rat me out?

1347
01:27:25,625 --> 01:27:28,458
I'm okay with what happened.
But one thing I don't get it.

1348
01:27:29,625 --> 01:27:31,875
If you were truly
a resort-owner…

1349
01:27:32,208 --> 01:27:33,583
you would've filed a
complaint with the police.

1350
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,791
Instead, you seek me out and
you're here to discuss terms with me.

1351
01:27:40,666 --> 01:27:43,958
What I don't get is, how come
a resort-owner is go gutsy?

1352
01:27:45,333 --> 01:27:47,916
Either you're
police or a criminal.

1353
01:27:49,916 --> 01:27:51,500
If you are police…

1354
01:28:00,333 --> 01:28:02,833
I'm not police. That
I can promise you.

1355
01:28:03,583 --> 01:28:04,958
But I want to tell
you something.

1356
01:28:06,125 --> 01:28:07,958
It really doesn't matter if
you are a big gangster…

1357
01:28:08,333 --> 01:28:10,875
you can't step out of
Goa, if you shoot me dead.

1358
01:28:11,375 --> 01:28:13,041
All you need is just any girl.

1359
01:28:13,833 --> 01:28:16,208
But I want the girl
you've kidnapped.

1360
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:18,416
I'll give you a girl.

1361
01:28:19,041 --> 01:28:20,458
You return that girl to me.

1362
01:28:20,833 --> 01:28:22,000
Problem solved.

1363
01:28:22,750 --> 01:28:24,333
How come a resort
owner is into kidnapping?

1364
01:28:24,958 --> 01:28:26,666
You own a ice cream parlor.

1365
01:28:27,166 --> 01:28:29,708
And I own a resort.
That's the only difference.

1366
01:28:30,750 --> 01:28:34,166
Do you still think I'm a
fool to believe your stories?

1367
01:28:34,708 --> 01:28:36,041
You don't have to
believe what I'm saying.

1368
01:28:36,833 --> 01:28:38,041
But you'll believe your eyes, right?

1369
01:28:50,708 --> 01:28:52,708
Keep 200 meter radius and follow them.

1370
01:29:00,791 --> 01:29:03,791
-How long have you been doing this?
-Twelve years!

1371
01:29:05,416 --> 01:29:06,833
I'm ten years senior to you.

1372
01:29:07,875 --> 01:29:08,750
Oh!

1373
01:29:13,708 --> 01:29:14,875
Keep the target in sight.

1374
01:29:15,375 --> 01:29:16,208
Okay, sir.

1375
01:29:22,625 --> 01:29:24,166
Don't get too
close to the target.

1376
01:29:51,166 --> 01:29:52,083
Target on sight.

1377
01:29:57,625 --> 01:29:59,416
Boys, you know the drill.
On my command!

1378
01:30:38,833 --> 01:30:39,750
Number 3!

1379
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:44,416
Number 2!

1380
01:30:47,250 --> 01:30:50,000
The target is at 37° 06' 43'' W.

1381
01:31:19,750 --> 01:31:22,208
You can pick any girl you want.

1382
01:31:46,083 --> 01:31:47,666
They're very young girls.

1383
01:31:49,541 --> 01:31:51,208
Until they hit puberty,
we keep them here.

1384
01:31:52,125 --> 01:31:53,833
Only after that will I export them.

1385
01:31:55,291 --> 01:31:56,416
Virgin export.

1386
01:31:56,916 --> 01:31:58,375
That's the current demand.

1387
01:32:01,166 --> 01:32:03,000
I thought you said you're
ten years senior to me.

1388
01:32:03,791 --> 01:32:05,666
But your actions
state something else.

1389
01:32:07,625 --> 01:32:08,708
What makes you say that?

1390
01:32:10,416 --> 01:32:12,458
You've hardly known me for two days.

1391
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:16,083
But you've already shown
me your vital hideout.

1392
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,416
What if I turn
out be the police?

1393
01:32:19,791 --> 01:32:20,791
What will you do?

1394
01:32:22,208 --> 01:32:24,833
If you're truly police,
what would you do?

1395
01:32:25,625 --> 01:32:26,750
I would've come with the force.

1396
01:32:27,958 --> 01:32:30,250
Once I got settled inside,
I would've informed them.

1397
01:32:30,875 --> 01:32:33,458
They would've barged in and
took control over this place.

1398
01:32:33,958 --> 01:32:35,833
How long would
it take to control?

1399
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,208
Twenty to thirty minutes.

1400
01:32:39,250 --> 01:32:40,208
Gabbar!

1401
01:32:41,291 --> 01:32:42,208
Nazeer!

1402
01:33:24,583 --> 01:33:28,083
In just two minutes, I would have
disposed everyone into the ocean.

1403
01:33:28,833 --> 01:33:31,916
Just like how they found the Titanic…

1404
01:33:32,375 --> 01:33:34,750
it would take years for
them to recover their bodies.

1405
01:33:36,958 --> 01:33:37,916
Smart.

1406
01:33:41,666 --> 01:33:44,416
Okay, listen all units.
DC has a fail-safe.

1407
01:33:44,708 --> 01:33:46,750
-What?
-Abort plan!

1408
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:53,125
I feel ashamed to have
done this to one of our own.

1409
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,250
I'll return that girl.

1410
01:33:57,916 --> 01:33:59,041
You don't have to
do anything in return.

1411
01:34:00,333 --> 01:34:04,333
After looking at your grandeur
set-up, I have an offer for you.

1412
01:34:05,416 --> 01:34:06,333
What is it?

1413
01:34:06,750 --> 01:34:09,916
In the next ten days, I have to
ship 70 girls from India to Brazil.

1414
01:34:10,416 --> 01:34:13,458
I have 30 girls with me.
Can you give me 40 girls?

1415
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:16,333
I'm ready to pay
any price for that.

1416
01:34:16,708 --> 01:34:17,750
I know it's tough.

1417
01:34:18,416 --> 01:34:21,333
Only, if you can
pull it off, say okay.

1418
01:34:37,875 --> 01:34:40,625
I don't know what else is
out there. So, let's not risk it.

1419
01:34:41,583 --> 01:34:43,791
You guys can leave.
Thanks for coming.

1420
01:34:44,166 --> 01:34:45,750
We can plan and
execute it meticulously.

1421
01:34:46,166 --> 01:34:47,041
Hear me out!

1422
01:34:47,666 --> 01:34:50,333
Colonel, more than courage
we need intelligence out here.

1423
01:34:50,916 --> 01:34:52,791
It's fine, if you or I
die in the process.

1424
01:34:53,458 --> 01:34:54,833
But young lives are involved.

1425
01:34:55,583 --> 01:34:58,125
-So, let's not risk it.
-Talk like a military man.

1426
01:34:58,750 --> 01:34:59,875
Risk is a given.

1427
01:35:00,791 --> 01:35:03,041
I don't want a plan that saves only eight
out of ten lives.

1428
01:35:03,458 --> 01:35:05,583
I want a plan that
can save all 10 lives.

1429
01:35:06,208 --> 01:35:08,083
I'll do what suits me the best.

1430
01:35:08,416 --> 01:35:09,333
I don't need your advice.

1431
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:11,708
You don't have the
experience that I have in this.

1432
01:35:12,250 --> 01:35:13,541
You will regret this.

1433
01:35:14,708 --> 01:35:15,666
Goodbye!

1434
01:35:22,166 --> 01:35:24,208
It's better think
about it ten times…

1435
01:35:25,041 --> 01:35:26,333
before you take a giant leap.

1436
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,791
You've just known
him for two days.

1437
01:35:29,875 --> 01:35:32,000
And already he has huge demands.

1438
01:35:32,916 --> 01:35:34,625
What if he's a fraud?

1439
01:35:35,916 --> 01:35:38,125
The girls we kidnapped are
not going to go for a waste.

1440
01:35:39,041 --> 01:35:40,791
Only after we receive
the full settlement.

1441
01:35:40,958 --> 01:35:41,958
We'll deliver the girls,

1442
01:35:42,958 --> 01:35:46,125
If he turns out to be a fraud,
we'll burn him alive out here.

1443
01:35:48,541 --> 01:35:52,250
But if he's genuine, that'll
open up a new market for us.

1444
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,500
Our business will
have a wider reach.

1445
01:35:58,333 --> 01:36:01,416
Okay. Let me meet him once.

1446
01:36:09,916 --> 01:36:13,041
An ice-cream vendor indulging
in large scale human trafficking…

1447
01:36:14,208 --> 01:36:15,458
I'm finding it hard to believe.

1448
01:36:17,708 --> 01:36:19,791
A person who is running a
huge human trafficking network…

1449
01:36:20,125 --> 01:36:21,458
also owns a ice cream shop.

1450
01:36:22,166 --> 01:36:23,708
Is this believable, uncle?

1451
01:36:26,083 --> 01:36:27,166
One hundred percent!

1452
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,916
Only after you
settle the payment,

1453
01:36:30,291 --> 01:36:32,041
we'll board the girls
on to the containers.

1454
01:36:33,125 --> 01:36:35,125
If this works for you…

1455
01:36:36,041 --> 01:36:37,125
offer, okay!

1456
01:36:38,791 --> 01:36:39,791
Deal, okay!

1457
01:36:42,875 --> 01:36:45,166
But before we finalize the deal…

1458
01:36:45,666 --> 01:36:47,500
you'll have to
speak to our boss.

1459
01:36:51,958 --> 01:36:54,375
Okay, we'll talk to him.

1460
01:36:55,625 --> 01:36:59,166
But before you speak to him,
bear two things in your mind.

1461
01:36:59,625 --> 01:37:03,083
One. You can answer only
if you're questioned by him.

1462
01:37:05,166 --> 01:37:09,833
Two. You have to address
him as Don Pablo El-Fino.

1463
01:37:11,375 --> 01:37:14,291
Don Pablo El-Fino.

1464
01:37:14,791 --> 01:37:15,791
Repeat it.

1465
01:37:16,291 --> 01:37:18,291
-We'll repeat it to him.
-No!

1466
01:37:18,958 --> 01:37:21,041
He doesn't like it when people
mispronounce his name.

1467
01:37:21,583 --> 01:37:23,208
So, you'll have to repeat it.

1468
01:37:29,208 --> 01:37:32,583
Don Pablo El-Fino.

1469
01:37:35,708 --> 01:37:37,291
Don Pablo El-Fino, hola!

1470
01:37:37,625 --> 01:37:42,500
These two men have been the best
in the business for a very long time.

1471
01:37:44,875 --> 01:37:46,958
Don Pablo El-Fino, hola!

1472
01:37:51,916 --> 01:37:53,833
What happened? Why
did he shut it down?

1473
01:37:55,583 --> 01:37:56,416
One minute.

1474
01:38:03,708 --> 01:38:06,250
Dad, why didn't you
repeat what I taught you?

1475
01:38:06,541 --> 01:38:08,791
Son, he's a useless
supporting actor.

1476
01:38:08,958 --> 01:38:10,625
You chose a wrong person to act.

1477
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:11,875
<i>Hang up the phone.</i>

1478
01:38:14,250 --> 01:38:15,333
Wear your lungi!

1479
01:38:15,583 --> 01:38:18,250
-You take your payment and leave.
-Okay.

1480
01:38:19,208 --> 01:38:21,291
I'm sorry. The deal is off.

1481
01:38:21,875 --> 01:38:22,833
Let's end it here.

1482
01:38:24,375 --> 01:38:25,250
Why is the deal off?

1483
01:38:25,625 --> 01:38:27,791
My boss is not
able to trust you.

1484
01:38:28,166 --> 01:38:30,958
He believes that you can't pull
off a project of this magnitude.

1485
01:38:31,291 --> 01:38:33,416
In how many days
did you need the girls?

1486
01:38:34,125 --> 01:38:35,041
In ten days.

1487
01:38:35,916 --> 01:38:37,500
I'll get them to you in five days.

1488
01:38:38,083 --> 01:38:39,166
Terry…

1489
01:38:40,166 --> 01:38:42,000
call all our men tomorrow.

1490
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:43,958
Speak to them in Varun's presence.

1491
01:38:45,458 --> 01:38:47,916
Six day from today…

1492
01:38:49,125 --> 01:38:50,500
the girls will be been shipped.

1493
01:38:51,208 --> 01:38:53,125
And then, I'll speak to your boss.

1494
01:38:55,583 --> 01:38:58,625
You've been conning them profusely.
What if he finds out?

1495
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:00,666
Definitely, he'll find out.

1496
01:39:01,041 --> 01:39:02,666
And when he does, he'll kill all of us.

1497
01:39:02,750 --> 01:39:03,958
So, why are you doing this?

1498
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:06,375
But it'll take time for him to find out.

1499
01:39:06,541 --> 01:39:08,458
By then, we would've finished
our mission and escaped.

1500
01:39:08,916 --> 01:39:12,250
Plan B is now in motion.
You guys start your game!

1501
01:39:17,791 --> 01:39:21,125
They're going to ask me
crazy stuff like, you know…

1502
01:39:21,791 --> 01:39:22,625
105…

1503
01:39:22,916 --> 01:39:23,750
106…

1504
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:24,833
107…

1505
01:39:25,125 --> 01:39:25,958
108…

1506
01:39:26,166 --> 01:39:27,000
109…

1507
01:39:31,708 --> 01:39:33,541
-It hurts, damn it!
-You wanted to act, right?

1508
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:34,916
So, endure it.

1509
01:39:35,666 --> 01:39:38,250
-Enough! Take the money.
-Thank you.

1510
01:39:40,458 --> 01:39:42,708
Bloody, you broke my hand.

1511
01:39:43,166 --> 01:39:44,958
I'll practice well and return
tomorrow to defeat you.

1512
01:39:46,875 --> 01:39:49,250
You'll wake up in the morning.
But I doubt your hand will.

1513
01:39:53,291 --> 01:39:55,541
I'm going to break it.
I'll break all ten fingers.

1514
01:39:55,791 --> 01:39:57,083
I'm going to break his hands too.

1515
01:39:57,291 --> 01:39:58,500
I won't spare him.

1516
01:39:58,708 --> 01:40:01,083
-You can't defeat him in this life.
-Why?

1517
01:40:02,125 --> 01:40:04,458
You gotta be fast like a tiger!

1518
01:40:04,791 --> 01:40:05,666
But you're a…

1519
01:40:06,875 --> 01:40:07,791
tortoise.

1520
01:40:07,875 --> 01:40:10,000
Go and apply some
coconut oil on your hands.

1521
01:40:10,208 --> 01:40:12,541
Don't worry. You'll
be fine. Small bugger!

1522
01:40:13,250 --> 01:40:15,458
Hey, it's easy to
speak, damn it.

1523
01:40:15,583 --> 01:40:17,375
But in action,
you can't do squat.

1524
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:18,458
-Do you know who is he?
-Who?

1525
01:40:18,541 --> 01:40:20,833
You don't know his
strength. Try challenging him.

1526
01:40:21,166 --> 01:40:23,083
-I don't have money, bro.
-I'll lend you.

1527
01:40:28,041 --> 01:40:30,041
There are five rules to follow.
Listen carefully.

1528
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,125
Rule number one!

1529
01:40:33,375 --> 01:40:37,416
Once the game begins, the
first person to tear up will lose.

1530
01:40:37,791 --> 01:40:40,458
Rule number two!
Freedom of speech.

1531
01:40:40,666 --> 01:40:43,875
To distract the opponent,
you can do trash talk.

1532
01:40:44,125 --> 01:40:45,083
Rule number three!

1533
01:40:45,208 --> 01:40:49,166
Without completing the challenge, if you
pick up your gun or knife out of anger,

1534
01:40:49,250 --> 01:40:51,958
you won't be considered as a man
and will be pronounced as a woman,

1535
01:40:52,083 --> 01:40:54,166
and we'll pin flowers to your head.

1536
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:56,000
Your name will be changed to Gomathi.

1537
01:40:56,083 --> 01:40:59,083
And you'll have to wear yellow
color Pommy's night dress.

1538
01:40:59,208 --> 01:41:00,750
Yours truly, Slap Hand Association.

1539
01:41:00,875 --> 01:41:02,208
Both of you, come inside.

1540
01:41:04,833 --> 01:41:07,083
First, do you wish
to touch my hand?

1541
01:41:07,375 --> 01:41:08,375
Come on, take a look.

1542
01:41:10,583 --> 01:41:13,458
Hey, he's mocking you and
you're giving him a chance.

1543
01:41:13,958 --> 01:41:15,458
You should never
lose your focus.

1544
01:41:15,583 --> 01:41:17,416
Okay, okay. I'll take care.

1545
01:41:17,916 --> 01:41:19,875
Don't just blurt out
words. Prove it in action.

1546
01:41:30,291 --> 01:41:31,250
Are you a doctor?

1547
01:41:31,666 --> 01:41:33,500
He's a doctor
and I'm the police.

1548
01:41:33,791 --> 01:41:36,916
You don't need to know.
You have soft hands, idiot.

1549
01:41:37,166 --> 01:41:38,416
He broke your hands
in just one blow.

1550
01:41:39,541 --> 01:41:40,500
Okay!

1551
01:41:41,625 --> 01:41:43,583
If you look at the procedure,
you may get scared.

1552
01:41:43,791 --> 01:41:46,083
Bhagat, pick up that towel
and hold it in front of his face.

1553
01:41:47,750 --> 01:41:48,791
He couldn't stand a chance.

1554
01:41:48,875 --> 01:41:51,541
But came down preaching
me about fighting.

1555
01:41:51,791 --> 01:41:54,333
Bloody, broke his
hand with just one blow.

1556
01:41:54,583 --> 01:41:55,833
Useless moron!

1557
01:42:09,458 --> 01:42:11,208
We'll run a check-up
after two weeks.

1558
01:42:11,958 --> 01:42:13,750
Until then, please be careful.

1559
01:42:14,625 --> 01:42:15,750
I have another request.

1560
01:42:16,875 --> 01:42:18,416
It's better if you
bury the hatchet.

1561
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,083
Don't pull in more
people into this mess.

1562
01:42:21,666 --> 01:42:24,541
Understood? Don't bring
more people to fight him.

1563
01:42:39,625 --> 01:42:40,583
Have a seat, please.

1564
01:42:44,708 --> 01:42:46,708
Everybody, meet Mr. Varun.

1565
01:42:47,166 --> 01:42:48,250
Our new associate.

1566
01:42:48,750 --> 01:42:51,791
We'll be venturing into a
new market with his support.

1567
01:42:54,583 --> 01:42:58,333
Now the reason you have been
called here today is to inform

1568
01:42:58,416 --> 01:43:02,458
that each one of you have
to deliver five girls in five days.

1569
01:43:03,041 --> 01:43:05,166
I know it's not an easy task.

1570
01:43:05,666 --> 01:43:06,875
But we have no choice.

1571
01:43:07,416 --> 01:43:08,958
As promises have been made.

1572
01:43:09,958 --> 01:43:11,125
Thank you all for coming.

1573
01:43:12,750 --> 01:43:13,750
Terry…

1574
01:43:14,708 --> 01:43:15,875
we need to talk.

1575
01:43:17,875 --> 01:43:20,000
Varun, please join us.

1576
01:43:52,333 --> 01:43:55,333
Terry, the appointment
has been fixed at 4:00 p.m. today.

1577
01:43:55,458 --> 01:43:56,291
Okay.

1578
01:44:08,541 --> 01:44:09,416
Thanks.

1579
01:44:10,458 --> 01:44:12,125
I have known Melvin for seven years.

1580
01:44:13,750 --> 01:44:14,708
Where's Alvin?

1581
01:44:16,083 --> 01:44:17,041
He's not well.

1582
01:44:18,541 --> 01:44:19,833
Actually, they're twins.

1583
01:44:19,958 --> 01:44:21,333
Powerful. Smart.

1584
01:44:21,625 --> 01:44:23,916
-And more importantly, loyal.
-Oh!

1585
01:44:29,416 --> 01:44:30,416
Tell me. What is it?

1586
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:33,208
I've been facing some issues.

1587
01:44:34,083 --> 01:44:36,416
I won't be able to deliver
the five girls you had asked for.

1588
01:44:37,791 --> 01:44:38,958
I need some time.

1589
01:44:40,833 --> 01:44:41,958
Cookies.

1590
01:44:50,791 --> 01:44:51,791
Bastard!

1591
01:45:02,458 --> 01:45:04,750
You were not in touch
with Alvin for two weeks.

1592
01:45:06,208 --> 01:45:08,333
And there has been no activity
whatsoever from your side.

1593
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,208
So, someone is holding Alvin as hostage…

1594
01:45:12,916 --> 01:45:14,916
and they have sent you to kill me.

1595
01:45:16,041 --> 01:45:17,000
Who is it?

1596
01:45:18,875 --> 01:45:22,333
If I reveal their identity,
they'll kill Alvin.

1597
01:45:23,708 --> 01:45:25,041
I can't tell you anything.

1598
01:45:25,666 --> 01:45:27,041
Tell me, what do I have to do?

1599
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:29,750
Give up all the girls
you have kidnapped.

1600
01:45:31,333 --> 01:45:33,208
And drop them off
from where you abducted them.

1601
01:45:33,708 --> 01:45:34,833
Don't be scared.

1602
01:45:35,375 --> 01:45:36,708
Tell me, who is it?

1603
01:45:41,291 --> 01:45:43,375
There's no way you can save us.

1604
01:45:44,666 --> 01:45:45,958
They are very close to you.

1605
01:45:47,208 --> 01:45:50,250
-Who is that big shot?
-That's the problem.

1606
01:45:51,250 --> 01:45:52,708
There is no big shot.

1607
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:54,625
They are ordinary people.

1608
01:45:55,458 --> 01:45:57,541
Before you find them…

1609
01:45:59,125 --> 01:46:00,666
they would have destroyed you.

1610
01:46:03,458 --> 01:46:04,500
Excuse me.

1611
01:46:23,750 --> 01:46:24,791
You killed him!

1612
01:46:25,416 --> 01:46:28,125
He gave me a clue already.
That's enough.

1613
01:46:36,958 --> 01:46:39,416
This the last batch of girls
delivered by Melvin.

1614
01:46:40,625 --> 01:46:43,166
I want to know about
the families and friends of these girls.

1615
01:46:43,666 --> 01:46:46,166
I want to know where they are
and what they are up to right now.

1616
01:46:47,291 --> 01:46:48,791
You have three days' time.

1617
01:47:05,666 --> 01:47:08,833
Hey, why are you hovering
the <i>sambar</i> like that?

1618
01:47:09,416 --> 01:47:11,250
I got hurt, Gabbar. You chill!

1619
01:47:12,291 --> 01:47:14,791
-What happened?
-My hand got jammed in the door.

1620
01:47:15,250 --> 01:47:17,791
Does that mean your eyes
were stuck up your butt?

1621
01:47:18,750 --> 01:47:19,708
Maybe.

1622
01:47:20,375 --> 01:47:21,250
Get lost!

1623
01:47:24,541 --> 01:47:26,375
Hey, pour me some <i>sambar</i>.

1624
01:47:30,083 --> 01:47:32,500
Why are you walking
as though you're on a ramp?

1625
01:47:32,666 --> 01:47:33,833
Take your hands out of your pocket.

1626
01:47:38,333 --> 01:47:41,166
-What happened to you?
-I bit my hand while having food.

1627
01:47:44,166 --> 01:47:46,625
I bit one hand. So, I used
the other one to eat…

1628
01:47:46,875 --> 01:47:48,458
and ended up biting that too.

1629
01:47:49,166 --> 01:47:51,083
Shall I feed you?

1630
01:47:51,375 --> 01:47:52,666
You can bite my hands too!

1631
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:55,166
Idiot! Get lost!

1632
01:47:59,125 --> 01:48:00,458
What are you guys up to?

1633
01:48:01,583 --> 01:48:03,500
Everyone has suffered similar injuries.

1634
01:48:05,583 --> 01:48:08,500
Are you taking money from me
and working for someone else?

1635
01:48:09,708 --> 01:48:10,625
Tell me!

1636
01:48:11,833 --> 01:48:12,791
Answer me!

1637
01:48:13,291 --> 01:48:16,041
Brother… it's just a game.

1638
01:48:18,208 --> 01:48:19,166
Game?

1639
01:48:19,791 --> 01:48:21,791
-Slap hand.
-Slap hand?

1640
01:48:22,875 --> 01:48:23,875
What is that?

1641
01:48:31,583 --> 01:48:35,541
Aren't you ashamed to have
injured yourselves over this game?

1642
01:48:36,166 --> 01:48:40,083
If this happens ever again,
I'll fire everyone!

1643
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:41,333
Get lost!

1644
01:48:41,416 --> 01:48:42,541
Listen, Gabbar.

1645
01:48:42,916 --> 01:48:45,291
I'm leaving this job right away.

1646
01:48:45,750 --> 01:48:46,583
Bye, guys!

1647
01:48:46,791 --> 01:48:49,541
What are you going to do
after quitting the job?

1648
01:48:49,708 --> 01:48:52,291
I'm going to seek revenge, bro.
I'm going to break his hand.

1649
01:48:52,666 --> 01:48:53,791
I can't take this anymore.

1650
01:48:54,083 --> 01:48:57,750
I will never forget
the things he said about my mom!

1651
01:48:59,208 --> 01:49:02,125
Who the hell is it?
He has messed everyone up!

1652
01:49:02,291 --> 01:49:04,500
Brother, he's a nobody. Let it go.

1653
01:49:04,666 --> 01:49:05,791
Let it go?

1654
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,125
Hey, he cussed out my mom!

1655
01:49:08,333 --> 01:49:09,625
What did my mom do?

1656
01:49:10,041 --> 01:49:12,291
Would you keep quiet
if he cussed at your mom?

1657
01:49:12,583 --> 01:49:14,250
I'll break open his head, dude!

1658
01:49:14,416 --> 01:49:15,458
Have you gone mad?

1659
01:49:15,750 --> 01:49:16,666
Mad?

1660
01:49:17,333 --> 01:49:19,208
I don't think you get it properly.

1661
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,958
In the end, he mentioned one thing.

1662
01:49:22,541 --> 01:49:24,625
He was asking for men to face him.

1663
01:49:24,958 --> 01:49:25,916
He said that to me!

1664
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:28,458
Where will I go to find men?

1665
01:49:28,875 --> 01:49:30,416
Do I look like a woman to him?

1666
01:49:31,250 --> 01:49:32,833
Do you have any men?

1667
01:49:33,416 --> 01:49:35,000
Where can I find him?

1668
01:49:36,041 --> 01:49:38,375
Sir, it's just a silly game.

1669
01:49:39,208 --> 01:49:42,333
And this game doesn't suit you.

1670
01:49:42,583 --> 01:49:44,416
I heard that no
one can defeat you.

1671
01:49:44,958 --> 01:49:46,041
I want to defeat you.

1672
01:49:46,750 --> 01:49:48,250
That's a silly wish.

1673
01:49:48,666 --> 01:49:52,041
If you can't, then you
might harm me later.

1674
01:49:52,125 --> 01:49:53,000
I'm scared!

1675
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:54,916
I have to play this game.

1676
01:49:55,583 --> 01:49:58,458
-I have to break your hand.
-Sir, please don't do it.

1677
01:49:58,833 --> 01:50:00,208
Sir, please don't do it.

1678
01:50:00,333 --> 01:50:03,125
Sir, please!
Hear me out, don't do it.

1679
01:50:03,500 --> 01:50:04,583
You've entered the ring!

1680
01:50:05,166 --> 01:50:07,791
Sir, only one leg
is inside the ring.

1681
01:50:08,083 --> 01:50:10,916
If you wish to play, hop in
with both the legs, damn it!

1682
01:50:12,708 --> 01:50:14,333
Bloody, hulk, step inside.

1683
01:50:14,958 --> 01:50:16,791
I'll be respectful
only outside the ring.

1684
01:50:17,041 --> 01:50:18,416
Once you step in,
I won't respect you.

1685
01:50:19,041 --> 01:50:22,125
Do you have grudge against
him? You got him webbed now.

1686
01:50:23,125 --> 01:50:25,125
-Who's going first?
-Come on, Gabbar.

1687
01:50:25,875 --> 01:50:27,708
-Yes. Don't spare him.
-You're too bulked up.

1688
01:50:27,916 --> 01:50:30,375
-But no play.
-Come on, Gabbar. Concentrate.

1689
01:50:30,625 --> 01:50:32,208
-Come on, bring it on!
-Ready?

1690
01:50:41,083 --> 01:50:43,166
Keep at it. You're doomed, man!

1691
01:50:43,375 --> 01:50:44,666
-Look at his physique.
-Don't give up. That's the way.

1692
01:50:44,875 --> 01:50:46,833
Your hand will turn inwards.

1693
01:50:49,583 --> 01:50:51,208
Out of the world. Just
finish him, Gabbar.

1694
01:50:51,291 --> 01:50:52,875
Your hands and
legs are shivering.

1695
01:50:54,250 --> 01:50:55,750
-Awesome!
-Oh, no!

1696
01:50:55,916 --> 01:50:57,541
-He's striking like a lightning.
-Come on, Gabbar!

1697
01:50:57,625 --> 01:50:59,416
You broke everyone’s'
hand in the city.

1698
01:50:59,666 --> 01:51:01,166
Life is a boomerang!

1699
01:51:01,250 --> 01:51:02,750
Come on, break his hand!

1700
01:51:03,083 --> 01:51:06,875
That's a lot of spit.
Gabbar, he's playing dirty.

1701
01:51:07,166 --> 01:51:08,875
He might even end
up peeing on you.

1702
01:51:09,125 --> 01:51:10,833
Make sure you're
ready to face anything.

1703
01:51:11,041 --> 01:51:13,166
Sir, let not do it.
I'm really scared.

1704
01:51:13,583 --> 01:51:16,583
-I don't want to do it.
-What? I don't get it.

1705
01:51:16,708 --> 01:51:18,833
Hey, he's just
too great a fighter.

1706
01:51:19,125 --> 01:51:20,208
I told you right that
he'll distract you.

1707
01:51:20,291 --> 01:51:22,708
-I'm going to rip you apart.
-Faster!

1708
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:24,750
-I'm going to break your hands.
-Come on, brother!

1709
01:51:25,291 --> 01:51:28,083
Hey, focus on his hands, damn it

1710
01:51:28,166 --> 01:51:30,583
Bloody poker face.
I'm going to thrash you.

1711
01:51:30,750 --> 01:51:32,166
Gabbar, quick. Take
you hands away.

1712
01:51:32,250 --> 01:51:33,083
Keep at it!

1713
01:51:33,166 --> 01:51:34,916
No matter how much you
hit me, I can bear the pain.

1714
01:51:35,041 --> 01:51:36,333
You'll bear the pain, is it?

1715
01:51:36,666 --> 01:51:38,791
Wait and watch.
Your eyes won't just tear up.

1716
01:51:38,958 --> 01:51:40,375
They'll be gouged out of your skull!

1717
01:51:52,083 --> 01:51:53,041
He's crying.

1718
01:51:53,375 --> 01:51:56,208
-Hey, I'm not crying.
-Oh, really?

1719
01:51:56,541 --> 01:51:58,916
Your tears have rolled
down to your pants.

1720
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:00,625
Gabbar, you cried. It's over.

1721
01:52:00,916 --> 01:52:01,875
Don't fool around.

1722
01:52:02,041 --> 01:52:04,708
-Hey, I'm not crying.
-Gabbar, don't lie.

1723
01:52:04,791 --> 01:52:06,291
Why are you being so stubborn?

1724
01:52:06,916 --> 01:52:07,875
Useless buffoon!

1725
01:52:08,250 --> 01:52:09,541
Don't you understand, damn it?

1726
01:52:09,750 --> 01:52:12,041
Gabbar has bit the dust!

1727
01:52:12,166 --> 01:52:14,875
Mr. Gabbar, didn't you read the rules?

1728
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,083
Flowers are pinned to his head.

1729
01:52:19,541 --> 01:52:22,458
Gomathi, why are you glaring at me?

1730
01:52:22,916 --> 01:52:25,083
Rightfully, you should
be staring at your men.

1731
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:28,333
But if I mention one thing,
you might get angry.

1732
01:52:28,583 --> 01:52:32,208
But it's a fact that these
flowers look pretty on you.

1733
01:52:33,750 --> 01:52:35,416
Can I take a selfie with you?

1734
01:52:38,458 --> 01:52:39,333
Gomathi, does it hurt?

1735
01:52:40,708 --> 01:52:42,375
Gomathi, I'm talking to you.
Does it hurt?

1736
01:52:42,458 --> 01:52:43,833
She'll tell you if it really hurts.

1737
01:52:43,916 --> 01:52:45,750
Stop tapping on the hand
and begin the procedure.

1738
01:52:47,750 --> 01:52:50,333
Gomathi, sister, please
let us know, if it hurts.

1739
01:53:11,166 --> 01:53:12,250
Pratap!

1740
01:53:17,458 --> 01:53:18,625
Please, open this.

1741
01:53:23,500 --> 01:53:25,041
-Put it inside.
-Me?

1742
01:53:26,916 --> 01:53:28,500
I won't be good, if
Gomathi looks at it.

1743
01:53:29,208 --> 01:53:30,291
Put it inside.

1744
01:53:40,541 --> 01:53:42,375
Now, you can
continue to apologize.

1745
01:53:43,250 --> 01:53:44,875
I don't see a need for it now.

1746
01:53:45,875 --> 01:53:49,208
Maybe I'll get some jasmine,
you can insert them into his nose.

1747
01:53:54,625 --> 01:53:57,125
Hey, can't you close the
door, when you're on the toilet.

1748
01:53:57,958 --> 01:53:59,666
-I thought of something.
-What is it?

1749
01:54:00,041 --> 01:54:01,708
What if all them belong
to the same family.

1750
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,833
And one of their own went missing
and they set out to look for her…

1751
01:54:05,083 --> 01:54:07,083
and hired us because
they were short of people.

1752
01:54:07,333 --> 01:54:09,708
Hey, why would you
think something like that?

1753
01:54:10,125 --> 01:54:12,375
Obviously, from the looks of it,
I don't feel we're here to kidnap.

1754
01:54:12,541 --> 01:54:13,750
It looks like we're
here to save someone.

1755
01:54:14,291 --> 01:54:16,000
There's no logic to
what you're saying.

1756
01:54:16,250 --> 01:54:17,875
If so, then whose
daughter is it?

1757
01:54:18,166 --> 01:54:19,833
Obviously, it's
Sumathi's daughter.

1758
01:54:20,791 --> 01:54:24,500
Hey, Sumathi, doesn't
look like a married woman.

1759
01:54:25,083 --> 01:54:26,958
She looks like a student
doing her 2nd year in college.

1760
01:54:27,416 --> 01:54:28,958
Right! She's in 2nd year.

1761
01:54:29,041 --> 01:54:30,541
And you're in 1st year
and I'm in kindergarten.

1762
01:54:30,750 --> 01:54:32,666
Mahali, our lives are at stake.

1763
01:54:32,750 --> 01:54:34,416
Killi, my love is at stake.

1764
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:37,541
-Hey, get lost.
-If she comes to know, she'll be hurt.

1765
01:54:40,833 --> 01:54:43,500
Sorry, please don't
take it to your heart.

1766
01:54:44,208 --> 01:54:45,375
He's a fool.

1767
01:54:46,708 --> 01:54:49,125
He was wrong, but
you caught it right.

1768
01:54:49,750 --> 01:54:51,208
That's why you are the boss!

1769
01:54:51,625 --> 01:54:52,541
Hats off!

1770
01:54:58,916 --> 01:55:00,208
Such a meticulous plan…

1771
01:55:00,541 --> 01:55:03,000
but he deduced it
sitting on a commode.

1772
01:55:03,333 --> 01:55:05,125
Actually, he's the boss!

1773
01:55:05,875 --> 01:55:08,000
And it's better for us, if
we lock him inside the toilet.

1774
01:55:15,625 --> 01:55:18,750
Terry, that girl's family
is staying at our resort.

1775
01:55:35,625 --> 01:55:37,666
You guys are hogging like mad.

1776
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,541
No one seem to care,
if he has eaten or not.

1777
01:55:40,791 --> 01:55:41,916
Are you worried about him?

1778
01:55:42,791 --> 01:55:44,750
Isn't he working
hard for our sake?

1779
01:55:44,916 --> 01:55:46,916
When he can do so much,
he surely knows how to eat too.

1780
01:55:47,333 --> 01:55:48,458
You better eat.

1781
01:55:49,958 --> 01:55:53,541
Park the romance for now.
And focus on finding your niece.

1782
01:56:12,875 --> 01:56:14,791
Everyone, sit down.

1783
02:00:00,083 --> 02:00:02,958
I'm sure they're not
capable of pulling it off.

1784
02:00:04,875 --> 02:00:06,958
There's someone above
them calling the shots.

1785
02:00:10,250 --> 02:00:11,125
What if it's him?

1786
02:00:13,208 --> 02:00:15,583
I feel he's the root
cause for all our problems.

1787
02:00:17,375 --> 02:00:19,083
Well, then, invite him
for the lunch too.

1788
02:00:45,500 --> 02:00:46,416
Sit.

1789
02:01:11,708 --> 02:01:14,208
If someone slaps a girl,
people tend to look at it.

1790
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:18,083
Instead, if you continue to
eat soup, won't he suspect us?

1791
02:01:27,958 --> 02:01:31,708
If you could reach at my
dining table, with fools like him…

1792
02:01:32,250 --> 02:01:34,000
you must be a
dangerous criminal.

1793
02:01:35,500 --> 02:01:37,583
What if I'm truly a
dangerous gangster?

1794
02:01:37,875 --> 02:01:39,291
Unaware, you might kill me.

1795
02:01:39,583 --> 02:01:42,291
And then, my men might
come and kill you all.

1796
02:01:42,625 --> 02:01:43,708
What would you do then?

1797
02:01:44,916 --> 02:01:47,583
Do you think I'll believe you?

1798
02:01:47,875 --> 02:01:49,875
You did believe
me all this while.

1799
02:01:51,666 --> 02:01:52,791
Mahali…

1800
02:01:54,208 --> 02:01:56,166
as he knows everything,
he won't believe me it seems.

1801
02:01:57,125 --> 02:01:58,208
I don't get it.

1802
02:01:58,750 --> 02:02:02,000
I conned him just
like I conned you.

1803
02:02:02,166 --> 02:02:04,250
You couldn't find
out. But he found out.

1804
02:02:05,875 --> 02:02:07,166
Did you con us?

1805
02:02:08,916 --> 02:02:10,791
-Hey, Killi.
-Last night I warned you.

1806
02:02:10,875 --> 02:02:12,000
But now you look shocked!

1807
02:02:12,250 --> 02:02:14,083
At least follow now and see
if you can make sense of it.

1808
02:02:14,375 --> 02:02:15,416
What about Sumathi?

1809
02:02:15,500 --> 02:02:17,333
Sumathi, Gomathi
were part of the plan.

1810
02:02:17,500 --> 02:02:19,541
Pass me the pepper. It's your
last supper. Eat it and die.

1811
02:02:30,916 --> 02:02:33,416
Not bad, I can see
fear in your eyes.

1812
02:02:34,125 --> 02:02:36,416
Don't worry, I won't kill her.

1813
02:02:37,083 --> 02:02:38,208
She is business.

1814
02:02:38,916 --> 02:02:40,791
But I'll kill each one of you.

1815
02:02:42,583 --> 02:02:44,041
Not like you expect it to be.

1816
02:02:45,083 --> 02:02:46,333
But like how I wish it to be

1817
02:03:18,666 --> 02:03:19,666
How long will it take?

1818
02:03:24,333 --> 02:03:26,083
I'm asking because
I'm feeling nauseous.

1819
02:03:29,958 --> 02:03:31,083
Do you at least have lemons?

1820
02:03:40,416 --> 02:03:42,000
I'm the reason
you people are in this mess.

1821
02:03:42,958 --> 02:03:44,958
Let me apologize to everyone.

1822
02:03:45,833 --> 02:03:46,708
Please!

1823
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,916
Hold on, dear. You don't
have to apologize to me.

1824
02:03:55,541 --> 02:03:56,458
Do you know why?

1825
02:03:58,208 --> 02:04:00,916
It's because you're
your mother's daughter.

1826
02:04:03,125 --> 02:04:04,083
Okay, Uncle.

1827
02:04:04,708 --> 02:04:07,000
Do you what that makes you?
That makes you Sumathi's brother.

1828
02:04:07,958 --> 02:04:09,333
I even got beaten
up in the process.

1829
02:04:09,666 --> 02:04:11,250
I even got bitten twice.

1830
02:04:11,875 --> 02:04:13,625
I should be apologizing to you.

1831
02:04:13,958 --> 02:04:16,625
I failed in this
mission to save you.

1832
02:04:17,083 --> 02:04:19,750
-As a police--
-At least don't lie to the kid.

1833
02:04:19,833 --> 02:04:23,875
As a friend of the police, I feel
ashamed to have failed you.

1834
02:04:27,875 --> 02:04:30,583
-Uncle.
-Shut up! Don't call me "uncle".

1835
02:04:31,041 --> 02:04:32,875
Couldn't you wait for your
folks if the school was over?

1836
02:04:33,083 --> 02:04:35,541
You left the school alone,
and someone kidnapped you.

1837
02:04:35,833 --> 02:04:37,500
And to save you, he kidnapped me.

1838
02:04:37,875 --> 02:04:39,541
And now, someone has kidnapped all of us.

1839
02:04:40,125 --> 02:04:41,541
You're such an annoying kid!

1840
02:04:42,250 --> 02:04:45,250
To hell with your sorry!
Just get lost!

1841
02:04:47,583 --> 02:04:49,166
I haven't been home for six months.

1842
02:04:54,041 --> 02:04:56,000
I know you too have the
same opinion about me.

1843
02:04:56,208 --> 02:04:58,666
Do you even know why
I left early from school?

1844
02:05:00,916 --> 02:05:04,291
In my family, except for me,
no one else would support you.

1845
02:05:04,833 --> 02:05:07,583
I knew if I was gone too,
then you'd be left in despair.

1846
02:05:08,833 --> 02:05:10,541
Do you know why
I came looking for you?

1847
02:05:11,625 --> 02:05:13,916
I know. You did it for Mini's sake.

1848
02:05:14,666 --> 02:05:16,083
No, I did it for your sake.

1849
02:05:21,375 --> 02:05:22,416
Really?

1850
02:05:23,375 --> 02:05:24,875
I like you a lot, Chinnu.

1851
02:05:26,916 --> 02:05:27,875
Thanks.

1852
02:06:02,458 --> 02:06:04,458
Oh, you're going to burn us alive!

1853
02:06:05,625 --> 02:06:09,291
Great, I'll burn and take solace in the
flames, and dance my heart away!

1854
02:06:12,833 --> 02:06:14,416
Look, what your
love has done to us.

1855
02:06:15,083 --> 02:06:17,083
Hey, why are you being
stingy with the logs?

1856
02:06:17,208 --> 02:06:18,541
Get more to burn us.

1857
02:06:18,625 --> 02:06:20,666
I think I'll die of heat before
you guys burn me down.

1858
02:06:20,791 --> 02:06:22,166
Picked the wrong day
to wear tight undies.

1859
02:06:22,458 --> 02:06:23,500
Put some wood out here.

1860
02:06:25,583 --> 02:06:26,750
Dude, help me out.

1861
02:06:28,416 --> 02:06:30,875
Make sure the knot is tight.
If not, I might fall into the sea.

1862
02:06:34,250 --> 02:06:36,041
Hey, stop right there.

1863
02:06:46,333 --> 02:06:49,291
I think he wants a re-match.
I'm going to rip him apart.

1864
02:06:51,791 --> 02:06:54,208
All these years, I never
asked you for anything.

1865
02:06:54,750 --> 02:06:56,750
But now, I have a request.

1866
02:07:12,416 --> 02:07:16,000
Brother, can you do
me one last favor?

1867
02:07:16,125 --> 02:07:17,541
Even in this dire situation?

1868
02:07:19,083 --> 02:07:22,208
Please you move to the other
side and let Varun come to this side.

1869
02:07:26,458 --> 02:07:28,916
Brother, can't you grant
me this one last favor?

1870
02:07:31,666 --> 02:07:34,625
Sister, they have crucified me.

1871
02:07:35,083 --> 02:07:37,166
And you expect
me to move around.

1872
02:07:37,375 --> 02:07:38,375
Don't you have any conscience?

1873
02:07:39,041 --> 02:07:40,208
Shut up and stay put.

1874
02:07:41,250 --> 02:07:45,625
Then ask Varun to come to this
side and you get to the other side.

1875
02:07:45,958 --> 02:07:48,208
Do you think he's comfortable
and cozy out there?

1876
02:07:48,375 --> 02:07:50,166
Can't you see that
he's been tied up too?

1877
02:07:50,541 --> 02:07:52,875
We're about to die and
you're in a romantic mood.

1878
02:07:54,708 --> 02:07:57,333
I'm on my death bed.
Please don't irritate me.

1879
02:07:57,625 --> 02:07:58,958
Did you say you're at Chetpet?

1880
02:07:59,416 --> 02:08:00,666
Help me, Lord!

1881
02:08:01,250 --> 02:08:02,083
Fine, look at him.

1882
02:08:05,375 --> 02:08:06,625
Your hair is blocking my view.

1883
02:08:07,041 --> 02:08:08,750
I don't have time
to cut my hair.

1884
02:08:08,958 --> 02:08:11,583
Mad woman, make the
best out of the situation.

1885
02:08:12,416 --> 02:08:13,333
Varun!

1886
02:08:15,166 --> 02:08:17,500
Varun, unintentionally
I've troubled you a lot.

1887
02:08:17,708 --> 02:08:18,958
Please forgive me!

1888
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,291
-Chinnu, don't be scared.
-Mom!

1889
02:08:27,750 --> 02:08:29,416
Stay strong as always.

1890
02:08:30,458 --> 02:08:33,708
My blessings will
always be with you.

1891
02:08:34,958 --> 02:08:38,625
Chinnu… when we're on
fire, please close your eyes.

1892
02:08:39,541 --> 02:08:40,625
Close your ears too.

1893
02:08:41,208 --> 02:08:44,541
When I'm on fire,
I'll scream like hell.

1894
02:08:50,666 --> 02:08:52,500
Hey, bring me the petrol.

1895
02:08:56,708 --> 02:08:59,333
-Ready!
-Go and get my father.

1896
02:09:37,666 --> 02:09:40,250
Headshot! What the shit?

1897
02:09:44,958 --> 02:09:47,041
To complete this operation,
you performed that operation.

1898
02:09:47,125 --> 02:09:48,541
Oh!

1899
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:57,000
Sir.

1900
02:09:58,083 --> 02:09:59,458
Your father is inside that bag.

1901
02:10:00,583 --> 02:10:01,666
Think about it.

1902
02:10:05,541 --> 02:10:08,375
Alvin, I'm sure you
must be aware…

1903
02:10:08,958 --> 02:10:11,916
that he must've
manipulated me to kill Melvin.

1904
02:10:12,958 --> 02:10:16,166
Sir, I might say a
million things to survive.

1905
02:10:17,125 --> 02:10:18,916
That doesn't mean
you can kill his brother.

1906
02:10:19,666 --> 02:10:22,416
Or do you think he'll spare
you for killing his brother?

1907
02:10:24,250 --> 02:10:26,916
Alvin, let's discuss
this among ourselves.

1908
02:10:27,375 --> 02:10:29,958
-But first, let's kill them all.
-How is that possible?

1909
02:10:31,458 --> 02:10:35,000
If he has put your dad inside a
bag and is pointing a gun at him…

1910
02:10:35,416 --> 02:10:37,458
this is all part of
my meticulous plan.

1911
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:39,791
So, I believe he must
be a bit loyal to me.

1912
02:10:41,625 --> 02:10:43,416
In case, out of anger
if I ask him to shoot…

1913
02:10:43,500 --> 02:10:44,500
he might shoot him.

1914
02:10:44,875 --> 02:10:46,208
It was you who had mentioned…

1915
02:10:47,250 --> 02:10:48,333
that he's very loyal.

1916
02:10:53,375 --> 02:10:54,583
Set them free.

1917
02:11:15,041 --> 02:11:17,416
Come on! Hurry up!

1918
02:11:25,125 --> 02:11:28,000
You guys settle your
score. We're leaving.

1919
02:11:40,083 --> 02:11:44,250
Alvin, I know that
you're outraged.

1920
02:11:46,125 --> 02:11:47,541
So, I'll make you a better deal.

1921
02:11:48,250 --> 02:11:50,333
Spare my father,
and kill me instead.

1922
02:11:51,583 --> 02:11:52,583
If I kill you…

1923
02:11:53,291 --> 02:11:57,916
then how will you realize
the pain of losing a loved one?

1924
02:11:58,958 --> 02:12:03,041
-So, this has to happen.
-What do you mean?

1925
02:12:30,875 --> 02:12:34,041
Mom, I think we
left one girl, behind.

1926
02:12:35,500 --> 02:12:38,791
Fine, the kids are hungry,
please ask them to hurry up.

1927
02:12:48,416 --> 02:12:49,583
It's just one girl.

1928
02:12:51,416 --> 02:12:53,375
We managed to save the others.

1929
02:12:53,791 --> 02:12:55,916
If you go back to
save that one girl…

1930
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:57,666
you won't come back alive.

1931
02:12:59,041 --> 02:13:00,833
Take it that I'm being selfish.

1932
02:13:01,666 --> 02:13:03,125
I want to get married to you.

1933
02:13:07,875 --> 02:13:09,333
I want to live with you.

1934
02:13:30,958 --> 02:13:31,791
Sir.

1935
02:13:32,750 --> 02:13:37,041
Sir, can we hold this girl as
hostage to bring him back?

1936
02:13:44,625 --> 02:13:47,916
I'm in this situation
because I hired fools like you.

1937
02:13:49,291 --> 02:13:50,666
After such a debacle…

1938
02:13:51,083 --> 02:13:53,208
do you really think
he'll come back for her?

1939
02:13:53,708 --> 02:13:54,583
Fool!

1940
02:14:16,416 --> 02:14:17,875
I left one girl behind.

1941
02:14:18,625 --> 02:14:20,041
I'm here to take her with me.

1942
02:14:30,583 --> 02:14:32,208
How dare you came back for her?

1943
02:14:33,208 --> 02:14:35,666
You took away all
the girls from me.

1944
02:14:36,458 --> 02:14:37,750
You killed my father too.

1945
02:14:38,791 --> 02:14:42,458
And now, you're here to
take away that one last girl too.

1946
02:14:43,291 --> 02:14:44,166
I don't get it.

1947
02:14:44,791 --> 02:14:46,291
Are you a psycho who
loves to save people?

1948
02:14:47,250 --> 02:14:48,541
Who the hell are you?

1949
02:14:49,041 --> 02:14:50,000
Police?

1950
02:14:50,500 --> 02:14:51,333
Intelligence Bureau?

1951
02:14:51,791 --> 02:14:52,625
RAW?

1952
02:14:53,208 --> 02:14:54,458
Who are you?

1953
02:14:59,833 --> 02:15:00,916
Doctor!

1954
02:15:04,375 --> 02:15:06,250
You came here prepared to die.

1955
02:15:06,791 --> 02:15:08,666
If I shoot you right now,
you'll die in peace.

1956
02:15:08,875 --> 02:15:10,291
So, before you die…

1957
02:15:10,416 --> 02:15:13,791
witness the girl getting hacked to pieces.

1958
02:15:16,750 --> 02:15:17,708
Nazeer!

1959
02:15:37,250 --> 02:15:38,666
You returned to save her, right?

1960
02:15:39,541 --> 02:15:41,041
Nazeer, kill her!

1961
02:16:57,833 --> 02:16:58,791
Hold!

1962
02:17:00,166 --> 02:17:03,333
He must witness the girl
getting hacked before he dies.

1963
02:17:04,250 --> 02:17:06,041
Michael, come on! Finish her off.

1964
02:17:16,791 --> 02:17:18,125
As long as I live…

1965
02:17:18,958 --> 02:17:20,708
you cannot kill that girl.

1966
02:17:23,208 --> 02:17:24,750
If you wish to kill her…

1967
02:17:26,041 --> 02:17:27,541
you'll have to kill me first.

1968
02:17:28,125 --> 02:17:29,083
Kevin.

1969
02:17:34,250 --> 02:17:35,333
Shoot me…

1970
02:17:36,208 --> 02:17:37,416
and take her!

1971
02:17:38,833 --> 02:17:40,500
Terry, I'm very sorry for saying this…

1972
02:17:40,708 --> 02:17:42,375
but you're on an ego trip.

1973
02:17:42,541 --> 02:17:43,416
It's not safe for us.

1974
02:17:43,500 --> 02:17:46,250
Let's kill him first.
And then, we'll kill the girl.

1975
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:48,375
My point exactly.

1976
02:18:56,083 --> 02:18:57,541
This was never part of the plan.

1977
02:18:58,708 --> 02:19:00,333
I'm also surprised like you.

1978
02:19:01,750 --> 02:19:03,250
It is the outcome of my good deeds…

1979
02:19:05,250 --> 02:19:06,666
that has saved me today.

1980
02:19:07,541 --> 02:19:08,458
Anyway…

1981
02:19:10,250 --> 02:19:11,208
goodbye!

1982
02:19:30,208 --> 02:19:31,375
Thanks.

1983
02:19:32,166 --> 02:19:34,166
Doctors are not the only saviors.

1984
02:19:34,541 --> 02:19:35,791
Even the doctors need saviors!

1985
02:19:48,666 --> 02:19:50,541
Guys, let's finish this!

1986
02:20:23,208 --> 02:20:26,291
THREE MONTHS LATER

1987
02:20:27,291 --> 02:20:28,791
CHENNAI

1988
02:20:37,791 --> 02:20:40,625
-Hello?
<i>-Bhagat, at least now return our kidneys.</i>

1989
02:20:40,875 --> 02:20:44,250
Listen, fool! This is why
education is important.

1990
02:20:44,333 --> 02:20:47,083
You must have skipped school as a child,
and now you're making my life difficult!

1991
02:20:47,208 --> 02:20:48,833
It's impossible to take
out kidneys just like that!

1992
02:20:48,916 --> 02:20:49,750
<i>I don't understand.</i>

1993
02:20:49,833 --> 02:20:52,125
He just slit your abdomen
and stitched it up. That's it!

1994
02:20:52,208 --> 02:20:54,875
Your kidney is safe and sound.
Get a scan done and check it yourself.

1995
02:20:55,291 --> 02:20:57,125
Bloody idiot! Don't call me again.

1996
02:21:00,375 --> 02:21:01,916
Son, the police is here.

1997
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,750
Didn't you people file
a missing complaint?

1998
02:21:12,333 --> 02:21:14,083
Don't you follow-up
after filing a complaint?

1999
02:21:14,833 --> 02:21:15,958
I'm talking to you people.

2000
02:21:16,625 --> 02:21:20,875
So, we gotta work hard,
nab the accused and present to you, right?

2001
02:21:21,666 --> 02:21:23,250
We found the kidnapper.

2002
02:21:23,750 --> 02:21:25,833
-How did he find him?
-Hey, bring him here!

2003
02:21:29,125 --> 02:21:30,208
Moron!

2004
02:21:30,583 --> 02:21:31,791
Oh!

2005
02:21:32,291 --> 02:21:34,333
They just caught him now!

2006
02:21:34,666 --> 02:21:37,583
I think it'll take them another
five years to find Terry.

2007
02:21:37,708 --> 02:21:40,041
Even Chinnu would've got
married by that time.

2008
02:21:40,125 --> 02:21:41,000
Ignore him.

2009
02:21:41,125 --> 02:21:43,416
The auspicious time is about to end.
You should first get married.

2010
02:21:43,500 --> 02:21:47,333
Go on your honeymoon, create
TikTok videos and send them to me.

2011
02:21:47,458 --> 02:21:48,791
I'll enjoy watching them.

2012
02:21:49,125 --> 02:21:50,541
TikTok has been banned, Bhagat.

2013
02:21:50,625 --> 02:21:52,625
What! When did they ban TikTok?

2014
02:21:52,791 --> 02:21:55,333
Who gave them the permission
to ban it? I never got an email!

2015
02:21:55,916 --> 02:21:58,958
Forget TikTok, we'll shoot
a live duet! Come on.

2016
02:22:04,708 --> 02:22:08,208
<i>TikTok has been banned, my dear!</i>

2017
02:22:08,333 --> 02:22:11,666
<i>Come to me, my dear!</i>

<i>I don't need an umbrella</i>

2041
02:24:04,416 --> 02:24:07,583
